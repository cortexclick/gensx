Contexts provide a way to share data across components without explicitly passing them through props. They're similar to React's Context system but adapted for GenSX workflows. Contexts are particularly useful for:

- Sharing configuration across multiple components
- Providing dependencies to deeply nested components
- Managing state that needs to be accessed by multiple components

## Creating a Context

Here's how to create and use a context:

```tsx
// Create a context with a default value
const UserContext = gsx.createContext({ name: "default", age: 0 });

// Use the context in a component
const Greeting = gsx.Component<GreetingProps, GreetingOutput>(
  "Greeting",
  () => {
    const user = gsx.useContext(UserContext);
    return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
  },
);
```

## Using a Context

```tsx
// Provide a value to the context
const result = await gsx.execute(
  <UserContext.Provider value={{ name: "John", age: 30 }}>
    <Greeting />
  </UserContext.Provider>,
);
```

Contexts are a useful way to pass configuration without prop drilling. However, they do make your components less reusable so it is recommended that you use them sparingly.
