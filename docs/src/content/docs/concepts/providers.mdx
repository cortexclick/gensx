Providers are a specialized use of [contexts](../contexts) that focus on managing configuration and dependencies for your workflow. They're built using the context system, but provide a more focused API for configuration management.

The main provider available today is the `OpenAIProvider`, which manages your OpenAI API key and client:

```tsx
const result = await gsx.execute(
  <OpenAIProvider apiKey={process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}>
    <ChatCompletion
      model="gpt-4o-mini"
      messages={[{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }]}
    />
  </OpenAIProvider>,
);
```

Providers offer several benefits:

- **Centralized Configuration Management** - providers manage settings like API keys and feature flags keeping configuration separate from business logic.
- **Data Sharing** - providers give you an easy way to share data between components without prop drilling to simplify your code.
- **Reusability** - providers and their associated components can easily be reused in different parts of your application.
- **Scoped State Management** - providers can be used to manage state for parts of your workflow or the entire thing.

## Creating a Provider

If you want to use a provide that isn't available out of the box, you can easily create your own. The example below shows how to create a provider for the [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) API.

Start by importing `gsx` and the package you want to use:

```tsx
import { gsx } from "gensx";
import FirecrawlApp, { FirecrawlAppConfig } from "@mendable/firecrawl-js";
```

Next, create a context and then the provider:

```tsx
// Create a context
export const FirecrawlContext = gsx.createContext<{
  client?: FirecrawlApp;
}>({});

// Create the provider
export const FirecrawlProvider = gsx.Component<FirecrawlAppConfig, never>(
  "FirecrawlProvider",
  (args: FirecrawlAppConfig) => {
    const client = new FirecrawlApp({
      apiKey: args.apiKey,
    });
    return <FirecrawlContext.Provider value={{ client }} />;
  },
);
```

Finally, you can build components that use the provider.

```tsx
export const ScrapePage = gsx.Component<ScrapePageProps, string>(
  "ScrapePage",
  async ({ url }) => {
    const context = gsx.useContext(FirecrawlContext);

    if (!context.client) {
      throw new Error(
        "Firecrawl client not found. Please wrap your component with FirecrawlProvider.",
      );
    }
    const result = await context.client.scrapeUrl(url, {
      formats: ["markdown"],
      timeout: 30000,
    });

    if (!result.success || !result.markdown) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to scrape url: ${url}`);
    }

    return result.markdown;
  },
);
```

To use the `FirecrawlProvider` and `ScrapePage` component, you would then do the following:

```tsx
const markdown = await gsx.execute(
  <FirecrawlProvider apiKey={process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}>
    <ScrapePage url="https://gensx.dev/overview/" />
  </FirecrawlProvider>,
);
```
