# Blog Writer Loop Example

This example demonstrates how to use GenSX to create an AI-powered blog writing workflow that uses reflection to loop through an evaluation step. 

## What it demonstrates

- Basic GenSX workflow setup
- Generating long-form content using LLMs
- Simple prompt-to-blog-post conversion
- Reflective Agenic Pattern

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the example
pnpm run run
```

The example will generate a blog post based on the prompt "Write a blog post about performance optimization in MongoDB". You can modify the prompt in `index.tsx` to generate different content.
