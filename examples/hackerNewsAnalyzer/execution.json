Several commenters note the variability in review times, influenced by factors such as the complexity of the PR, the work culture, and individual or team habits. The sentiment is mixed, with some participants expressing frustration over slow reviews or dysfunctional team practices, while others appreciate a more trust-based, developer-driven approach. A recurring theme is the importance of setting clear guidelines and ensuring that review work is recognized and valued within the team's workflow. The comments suggest that while some developers work around formal PR processes, others advocate for structured and timely reviews to maintain code quality and team efficiency. Overall, the discussion underscores the need for balancing efficiency with thoroughness in code reviews. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656621)"

It is a simple tool made up of one HTML, one JavaScript, and one CSS file, saving projects into a single .yaml file. It can be easily hosted in a SharePoint environment and aims to simplify project management within security-constrained settings.\n\n**Discussion Highlights:**\n- A commenter appreciates the project's simplicity and open-source nature, noting the lack of lightweight Gantt tools (0 points). They suggest improvements like removing mandatory task categories and adding export options to PNG or SVG.\n- Another user points out the increasing reliance on SaaS for application delivery, noting that tools like Microsoft Project are costly and incompatible with MacOS (0 points). They express a preference for non-subscription-based tools.\n- Several comments compare SimpleGantt to other tools like Markwhen and discuss the benefits of local HTML apps with embedded JS for security and ease of use (0 points).\n- A feature request suggests the capability to reference existing charts through URL parameters (0 points).\n\n**Reception:**\n- The post scores 87 points, indicating a solid level of community interest.\n- Comment sentiment is generally positive, with appreciation for the tool's simplicity and functionality in regulated environments.\n- The discussion features constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement, but there is no significant debate, reflecting a consensus on the tool's utility and potential enhancements."

Most insightful: \"Over the last 15 years the browser has become more and more of an application delivery platform, and that notion has caused SaaS to run basically everything.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion highlights a positive reception of the open-source Gantt tool, with appreciation for its simplicity and lack of dependency on SaaS. Several users express a desire for more lightweight, cross-platform tools, noting the limitations of existing solutions like Microsoft Project and Jira. There is a shared sentiment of frustration with current Gantt chart offerings, leading to a deeper appreciation for the project discussed. Some users suggest additional features, such as the ability to export or reference remote charts, indicating areas for potential enhancement. The comment about SharePoint sparked curiosity and mild incredulity, but didn't develop into a broader debate, suggesting limited engagement. Overall, the lack of scored comments implies a more discussion-oriented than voting-oriented engagement. For more details, see the [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647668)."

The author highlights the challenge of finding a common set of features that work across different PDF engines and achieving keyboard input through a text input box. The project serves as a demonstration of the general-purpose scripting potential within PDFs, despite its janky execution.\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n- A comment (0 points) praises the ingenuity of circumventing browser restrictions to execute JavaScript, noting that such scripts typically require user interaction to run.\n- Another comment (0 points) humorously critiques the project for lacking features when printed to paper, emphasizing that the PDF's interactive elements do not transfer to print.\n- Security concerns are raised (0 points) about the capability of PDFs to execute code, highlighting the potential vulnerabilities in parsing complex document formats.\n- The capability of other PDF readers, like Acrobat, to execute JavaScript for decades is also acknowledged (0 points).\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- The post received 1227 points, indicating significant community interest and engagement.\n- Comments reflect a mix of admiration for the project's creativity and concerns over security implications. Despite many comments having a score of 0, they contribute to a vibrant discussion highlighting both technical marvel and potential risks.\n- There is a general consensus on the project's cleverness, though security concerns remain a notable point of contention."

Most upvoted: \"It&#x27;s a minor thing but I would remove the jQuery dependency. You&#x27;re not doing much with that plain javascript couldn&#x27;t do just as well if not better. Plain JS has come a long way since jQuery first came out.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"It looks like that&#x27;s a PHP codebase. I&#x27;m curious why one should use this solution instead of more performant Go&#x2F;Rust log backends?\"\n3. Most insightful: \"I’m curious about the open source nature of this and how you &#x2F; people in general manage a project where you are hosting it and need to maintain its security, but are also presumably merging pull requests as people contribute to the project.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion centered around the technical implementation of a logging service, with mixed opinions on its use of PHP and frontend technologies like jQuery. There is curiosity about the project's differentiation from existing solutions and concerns about managing security in an open-source context. While some comments question the choice of PHP over supposedly more efficient languages like Go or Rust, others provide feedback on improving documentation and user interface features. Despite no upvotes, the comments reflect typical concerns for developers regarding performance, security, and usability. The community did not seem to reach a consensus, indicating varied perspectives on the discussed topics. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42666139)"

There are any number of state and federal level privacy rules where liability may or may not come into play here. Have a privacy policy, follow it, protect other people&#x27;s data.If you&#x27;re not confident you know how to do that, find someone who is.

Although nearly complete and open to beta users, the creator seeks feedback before general availability.\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n1. Legal Concerns: Several comments (0 points each) emphasize potential legal liabilities, particularly regarding HIPAA compliance and privacy regulations. Commenters strongly advise the developer to pause the app's deployment and consult legal experts to navigate these issues.\n2. Implementation Criticism: A comment (0 points) critiques the app's novice development approach, suggesting potential risks and advocating for a more cautious, legally informed rollout.\n3. Healthcare System Insight: Another comment (0 points) appreciates the app's concept, highlighting the need for better coordination tools in healthcare, but acknowledges the significant implementation challenges, especially regarding privacy and legality.\n4. Existing Solutions: A comment (0 points) notes that similar functionalities exist within platforms like MyChart, questioning the necessity of a separate app with potential liability.\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- The post's score of 157 points indicates strong community interest in the concept of Kate's App.\n- However, the comments reflect significant concern over legal and privacy issues, suggesting a need for cautious development and deployment.\n- The debate is centered on legal responsibilities and potential risks rather than the app's potential utility, indicating a consensus on the importance of regulatory compliance."

It&#x27;s all doable though, dont let the gatekeepers push you out.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve got my eye on right now is Palantir&#x27;s HealthStart initiative that seeks to streamline the compliance requirements needed to operate in this space legally.

There are any number of state and federal level privacy rules where liability may or may not come into play here. Have a privacy policy, follow it, protect other people&#x27;s data.If you&#x27;re not confident you know how to do that, find someone who is. We do have a responsibility to our users that goes well beyond our desire to learn and experiment.<p>Good luck!",

Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>. You can also try it via API: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client</a><p>TabPFN v2 is trained on 130 million synthetic tabular prediction datasets to perform in-context learning and output a predictive distribution for the test data points. Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

It has been published in Nature and supports datasets up to 10,000 samples and 500 features. The model excels in handling categorical features, missing data, outliers, and uninformative features, often outperforming systems like AutoGluon.\n\n2. **Notable Discussion Points:**\n   - A commenter noted that in a breast cancer example, a simple sklearn support vector machine slightly outperformed TabPFN, raising questions about expected performance (0 points).\n   - Another comment referenced CARTE-AI as a related tool, highlighting the improvements in TabPFN v2 over v1, particularly in handling categorical and missing values (0 points).\n   - Queries were raised regarding the availability of training data and code for model reproduction and improvement, as well as potential use cases in business settings (0 points).\n   - There was curiosity about extending TabPFN's capability to handle larger datasets beyond the current limitations (0 points).\n   - Some commenters questioned the model's ability to generalize given the domain-specific nature of tabular features and the use of synthetic data for training (0 points).\n   - Interest was shown in the potential applications of the model, including imputation of missing data for opinion analysis (0 points).\n\n3. **Overall Reception:**\n   - The post garnered a score of 149 points, indicating significant community interest.\n   - While there were no highly upvoted comments, the discussions were centered around technical details and potential improvements, suggesting an engaged and knowledgeable audience.\n   - The comments reflect a mix of curiosity and constructive critique, with no major consensus or debate emerging, likely due to the technical and niche nature of the content."

Most upvoted: \"The Box by Marc Levinson is the incredible story of the dawn of containerized shipping.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"Reading some of these books recommended here, perhaps the most shocking thing is that so much is due to randomness: an arbitrary person does something small that turns out to be on the critical path, and without it the big thing would not get completed.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes! Lots of detail, but it also shows how many geniuses it took working over years to really make it work.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion primarily features book recommendations centered on historical events and technological advancements. The community appears interested in books that provide detailed insights into significant historical and technological achievements, such as the development of containerized shipping, the atomic bomb, and the rise of Estonia as a tech hub. There is a notable appreciation for stories of human ingenuity and perseverance, as seen in recommendations like \"Endurance\" and \"Farthest North.\" The mention of randomness and survivor's bias in history writing sparks some reflection but does not generate significant debate. Overall, the comments reflect a shared enthusiasm for learning from past successes and challenges, with a focus on understanding the complex factors that drive innovation and exploration. The uniform score of zero across all comments suggests either a lack of engagement or a focus on content sharing over voting. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42614722)"

                      "text": "Hi HN! I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

                      "text": "Bin is an AI business intelligence analyst that turns data into dashboards. Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>. Please do let us know what you think – we’re open to feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve Bin.",

Most insightful: \"Reminder that sometimes empty alt text is _more_ accessible, in particular for images that have no bearing on the main subject of the page\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion centers on the use of AI, specifically gpt4o, to auto-generate alt text for images, with an eye towards efficiency and regulatory compliance. One commenter proposes this solution, suggesting it could streamline processes. Another commenter counters by highlighting an important nuance in accessibility: that sometimes, empty alt text is preferable, particularly for non-essential images. This reflects a deeper understanding of accessibility principles, suggesting that AI-generated text should not blindly replace expert judgment. The equal scores indicate a balanced discussion without clear consensus, possibly due to the complexity of the topic and the recognition that both automation and context-sensitive decisions have roles in accessibility.

It mentions a rotating magnet helmet and other unconventional approaches, like vortioxetine and the Zika virus, asking for community insights or experiences with these methods.\n\n2. **Notable Discussion Points**:\n   - A comment (0 points) advises against unconventional methods, recommending finding a reputable brain surgeon and considering clinical trials. It emphasizes supporting the patient's family and avoiding false hopes.\n   - Another comment (0 points) criticizes the thread for focusing on unverified personal anecdotes and experimental methods.\n   - The suggestion of water-only fasting combined with other treatments (0 points) is mentioned, with links to supporting articles.\n   - A comment (0 points) warns against unsolicited medical advice, emphasizing respecting the patient's wishes and consulting with medical professionals.\n   - The risk of addiction due to prescribed painkillers is highlighted (0 points), sharing a personal story of a fatal overdose linked to cancer pain management.\n   - A ketogenic diet is suggested (0 points), with a disclaimer about the poster's lack of medical expertise but recommendation from a physician.\n   - Recommendations for reputable medical centers like MD Anderson and UCSF for treatment and clinical trials are provided (0 points), along with personal offers of support for housing.\n\n3. **Overall Reception**:\n   - The post's score of 153 points indicates significant community interest, perhaps due to the serious and personal nature of the subject.\n   - Comments reflect a mix of skepticism towards unverified treatments and practical advice, with no clear consensus emerging. The lack of upvoted comments suggests a cautious or critical reception of the proposed \"bio hacks.\"\n   - Discussion quality varies, with some comments providing thoughtful recommendations and others critiquing the focus on non-traditional methods. The lack of high-scoring comments indicates either a divided opinion or a lack of strong community endorsement for any particular viewpoint."

Unfortunately the short answer is that there is no cure and there is treatment that might be a cure under development. There are treatments that slow the course, and the patient’s doctors know all of them and they will recommend what’s best. This is an area of medicine that is hard for amateurs to learn about, and a neurooncologist has decades more training than their patients. The reality is this is a horrible disease that currently has no cure - and the treatments that work are all complex medicines prescribed by specialists.",

He died of an opioid overdose.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion revolves around supporting a friend with brain cancer, with comments emphasizing traditional medical care and caution against false hopes from unproven treatments. The community largely agrees on the importance of professional medical intervention from reputable institutions like Sloan Kettering and Mayo Clinic. However, there is skepticism towards anecdotal treatments and alternative therapies, as reflected in comments that question the validity of such approaches. The comment about opioid addiction highlights a broader perspective on patient care, emphasizing the multifaceted risks associated with terminal illness. Overall, a consensus emerges that professional medical advice and emotional support are paramount. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42649996)"

Keep collecting interesting anecdotes. Culture some depth to your personality that is unrelated to work (e.g. interesting hobbies). Essentially train your charisma.<p>2) The big eye opener for me was the discovery that different groups of people actually react differently to me. I.e. I was simply friends with people who ... didn&#x27;t care as much about me as I cared about them. The blunt fix here is to change your social circles.

Don&#x27;t over indulge them, but everyone is equal in this world, and hearing them out on things leads to a healthy discourse.<p>One final tip and this is important, if they talk about a trip to the Bahamas or whatever and you then feel the urge to bring up your similar trip to the Bahamas, maybe don&#x27;t. Instead of hearing their point of view, you&#x27;re making the conversation about you immediately and people don&#x27;t like that. You can hold that thought and bring it up later in the conversation, organically.",

It aims to provide an open-world streaming support, a feature typically found in more expensive engines like Unreal or Source, but in a lightweight, open-source format. The creator highlights the project's old-school roots, modern optimization, and potential benefits for developers frustrated with current mainstream engines.\n\n**Notable Discussion Points:**\n1. **Turbobloat Criticism:** Several comments (0 points) critique current game engines for being bloated, making software slower despite more powerful hardware. There's a sentiment that lightweight, efficient engines like Tramway can counteract this trend.\n2. **Educational Impact:** One comment (0 points) discusses the influence of academic curriculums on the popularity of certain engines like Unity and Unreal, suggesting that easier teaching tools drive their adoption, not necessarily their quality or efficiency.\n3. **Visual Quality & Nostalgia:** Commenters (0 points) reflect on the enduring visual appeal of older games like Half-Life 2, suggesting a demand for simpler, less graphically intense games reminiscent of early 2000s titles.\n4. **User Experience:** A few users (0 points) appreciate the straightforwardness and well-designed documentation provided by the Tramway SDK, noting it as a refreshing change from more complex engines.\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- **Post Score:** The post garnered 654 points, indicating significant community interest and relevance.\n- **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** While the comments have low individual scores, they reflect a consistent appreciation for the project’s potential to address current industry issues like software bloat and the demand for simpler game engines.\n- **Level of Debate or Consensus:** There is a general consensus appreciating the project, though discussions highlight broader industry critiques rather than direct debate about the SDK itself. No major disagreements are evident, suggesting an overall positive reception."

I stay on top of cutting-edge technologies to stay relevant, but I’ve mostly seen AI&#x2F;LLMs as powerful tools for augmenting specific tasks rather than fundamentally reshaping engineering as a discipline.<p>However, NVIDIA’s recent CES keynote was another data point in a growing list challenging that view. While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences. I lack the resources to test these claims in depth, so I’m turning to HN for firsthand insights—not sales pitches or market hype.<p>If you’re using NVIDIA’s AI tools (like NeMo, Omniverse, COSMOS, etc.) or broadly working with LLMs&#x2F;multi-modal AI in your daily work or business, I’d love to know:<p>- What are you actually achieving with them?<p>- What are their limitations? Where do they fall short?<p>- What&#x27;s the reliability of the results? Demo-worthy Deployment-ready for high-stakes environments?<p>- Are the challenges you encounter just a matter of “more compute&#x2F;money,” or are they fundamental barriers?<p>- Do these tools help you reach production faster compared to traditional methods?<p>- Anything else you think may be interesting.<p>I’m looking for honest, real-world insights from those at the front lines of these technologies.",

Commenters acknowledge the advancements in AI but highlight key limitations such as hallucinations, the uncanny valley effect, and the reliability of AI-generated content. There is concern over the corporate influence on AI behavior, especially in publicly available models. The comment about the limitations of LLMs provides a more technical perspective, focusing on architectural constraints. The lack of upvotes or downvotes indicates a potentially niche interest or a balanced debate without strong consensus. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808)"

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.

Most upvoted: \"Keep lab notes! I keep detailed daily notes of what I've learned, code I've run, what my todo list is, etc. in markdown...\"\n2. Most controversial: \"It is surprising that this still happens, but I’ve had senior engineers (L6-L7 from FAANG) join my teams (multiple examples, different companies) and in the first couple days make extremely superficial but strong arguments...\"\n3. Most insightful: \"Something that has always been really appreciated, and can be an easy 'first commit': update/complete the docs...\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion primarily revolves around effective strategies for new hires, especially senior engineers, joining technical teams. The key points of consensus involve understanding existing processes before suggesting changes, documenting the onboarding experience, and actively listening to team members. The comments collectively emphasize the importance of humility and patience in adapting to and understanding a new company's culture and processes. The community generally agrees (score 0 across the board) that proactive documentation, understanding team dynamics, and learning from others are crucial for effective onboarding. However, there is a cautionary tone against making hasty changes or assumptions, particularly highlighted by the comment on senior engineers making premature suggestions, which resonates as a common issue. This sentiment underscores a shared understanding that respect for existing workflows and team dynamics is essential for a smooth transition into a new role.

                      "text": "Trading cards are awesome, but paying $30 for some cardboard isn’t. I’ve upscaled 60,000 cards from the entire catalog of Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, &amp; a newer game, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com</a>. I&#x27;ve made it easy to build a decklist, download it, and then print at home. Modern inkjet printers got really good when nobody was looking. While it’s clear they’re not real cards, the upscaling makes them look great for casual play (these are not tournament legal). It’s totally free, give it a try!<p>Supplies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies</a>\nPrinter Settings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings</a>\nInstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions</a><p>Overview: I built Cardstock because I had some scripts to do this lying around, and wanted to explore the new Rails 8 magic. Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

Enthusiasts appreciate the technology and the potential for creating proxies at a low cost, as indicated by the comment about printing an entire cube. However, criticisms center around the user experience, particularly the lack of information and the necessity of an account to use the service, which some users find off-putting. The caution about a potential legal challenge from Wizards of the Coast suggests a concern about the project's viability. Overall, the comments reflect a community divided between those impressed by the idea and those wary of its presentation and legal implications.

My father bought me Sinclair ZX Spectrum+ when I was in the first grade. Since then, computers were part of my life, significantly. I stare at my screen almost whole day. One day there was some voice in me saying &quot;Buy a typewriter&quot;. I listened to the voice and bought Smith Corona Silent from 1946. It was the most profound experience I ever had with some kind of machine. I was not so happy when I got my first cell phone, and later smartphone nor computer. This is something different, probably because the basics are the same, I&#x27;m still typing.<p>Suddenly I found myself writing a diary, and a novel. I never wrote anything other than blog posts (many of them since I had website similar to The Verge) - which I sold later.<p>I now have 3 typewriters, 2x Smith Corona Silent (1946 and 1956), and Olympia Monica (I think it&#x27;s from &#x27;70).<p>What I found very interesting is that writing on a typewriter is perfectly synchronized with how fast my mind is working. Time slows down! I read that on the web somewhere, and it is slowing the time when you type on a typewriter! I can confess that!<p>My fingers are too fast on computer keyboard, and I even don&#x27;t want to talk about distractions like auto correct and other stuff that always pops up. This is something what really makes me feel good. I can write a story, poem, diary, or a letter to a friend.<p>It&#x27;s truly something we should have on our desk somewhere in the room, and just put our thoughts on a paper.",

The Olympia with script typeface was a bargain, but it is script. The 6CPI SCM was a surprise. Can you live with the typeface?<p>+ are you handy? Typewriter service is basic millwrighting. You will want decent flathead screwdrivers and some time on Youtube.<p>[1] If I come across another SCM with 6CPI for the right price I will have two typewriters. 6CPI changes the way I write and matches well with images...I got the Hermes Baby because I wanted a small font. It was too small and the way the text looked on the page turned me off. The Olympia is good enough, which is good enough.",

                      "text": "Hi,<p>As an enthusiast chess player, I like to manage my games and my opening repertoire as a set of PGN files stored in a Git repository (PGN is a text file format for recording chess games). So I wanted a way to pretty-print PGN files using a CLI and integrating in my editor.<p>Today, it looks like most people use GUI-based software. So I decided to create a Prettier plugin that formats PGN files. Prettier is a well-known pretty-printer in the Node.js ecosystem, used to ensure consistent source code formatting in software projects. One upside of implementing this PGN formatter as a Prettier plugin is that it benefits from its editor integration.<p>The plugin is currently near complete, even if the project is still at an early stage. It&#x27;s usable, even if there might be some bugs.<p>Hope you find this useful. Comments and ideas are welcome. Have a nice weekend.",

So pgn pretty-printing is at the same level as pretty printing json. Nothing wrong with that, but at some point you might want to publish a game with diagrams variations, ....

Thank you!\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion is centered around tools and techniques for improving chess game documentation and sharing. One comment shares a Chrome extension for printing PDFs from Lichess, indicating a practical contribution to the community. Another participant expresses gratitude for the tool while contemplating a similar project, demonstrating a collaborative spirit and interest in personal productivity tools. A comment about using LaTeX for chess notation reflects a deeper technical insight, suggesting alternatives for presenting chess games beyond basic PGN formatting. The scores, while all zero, suggest a neutral reception, but the content points to an engaged and helpful community exchange. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42594896)"

I now have the suspicion that the issue I&#x27;m having isn&#x27;t the tooling, but the process.

What resources have you learned how to use your applications of choice?<p>My requirements (in rough priority order):<p>- Mobile + Desktop support (PWA, web UI, native application, all fine!)<p>- Searchable<p>- Allows me to keep track of todos with priority ordering and sublists<p>- Allows me to easily capture one-off ideas, as well as expand them into richer, more detailed concepts<p>- FOSS + Self-Hostable<p>The issues I&#x27;ve faced with previous solutions are:<p>- No integration between my todos and knowledge!<p>- Not being able to search<p>- Not being able to quickly capture ideas&#x2F;notes&#x2F;todos<p>- Not having a clean(-ish) UX to navigate between points of info&#x2F;see what my next priorities are",

The sentiment is mixed as users share personal preferences without a clear consensus, reflecting the diversity of needs in task management. Tools like Obsidian and Trello are mentioned with specific use cases, while others like Zim, Emacs, and NotePlan are recommended based on individual experiences. The lack of votes suggests a shared interest but no dominant opinion, highlighting a fragmented landscape with no one-size-fits-all solution.

There is a noticeable lack of high-score comments, suggesting either a lack of consensus or insufficient compelling examples shared.\n   - **Level of Debate or Consensus**: The discussion lacks a strong consensus or breakthrough examples, with commenters providing anecdotal evidence and theoretical insights rather than definitive, widely-recognized instances of successful AI agent implementation."

Most upvoted: \"Been in BigCo land for 20 years now, and have seen the rise and fall of quite a few AI/ML/RPA etc fads.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"But these two claims aren’t compatible. If AGI and these super agents are that bonkers amazeballs that they can replace entire SaaS companies - then there is no way I’m going to be able to adapt my workflows to compete as a programmer.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"The key distinction from traditional automation: Agents handle variance and uncertainty by replanning rather than failing when their happy path breaks.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion reflects a general skepticism towards AI agents, with many commenters expressing doubts about their current and future capabilities. There is a consensus that while AI agents are touted as revolutionary, they often resemble glorified workflow automation rather than groundbreaking technology. The comments highlight a divide between the promise of AI and its practical implementation, with some users finding them useful for specific tasks but not transformative. The most insightful comment clarifies how agents differ from traditional automation by adapting to changes, which some users find valuable. Overall, the community's sentiment leans towards cautious optimism, with a strong undercurrent of skepticism and a call for more practical, streamlined solutions.

Similarly, the [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116) is a nod to classic game engines, offering a lean alternative to today’s software behemoths. This is a clear signal that many developers are yearning for simplicity and efficiency.\n\n3. **AI-Powered Enhancements in Everyday Tools**:\n   - AI is weaving its way into the fabric of our daily tools. Look at [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942) — it’s bringing AI into browser automation, simplifying what used to be tedious tasks. However, while the potential is vast, the practical challenges of adoption and utility remain high hurdles to clear.\n\n### Negative Themes: Concerns and Criticisms\n\n1. **Privacy and Data Management in AI Tools**:\n   - Privacy is like the elephant in the room when it comes to AI. [Open Rewind](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42596607) has sparked debates about how personal data is managed, especially in the cloud. The consensus is clear: if your tool isn’t prioritizing encryption and local storage, expect wary users.\n\n2. **Performance Versus Readability in Educational Tools**:\n   - There's always a tug-of-war between readability and performance. Projects like Tinyhnsw spotlight this tension, where the educational value might drag on execution speed. This raises a fundamental question: can we strike a balance that serves both learners and practitioners?\n\n3. **Legal and Ethical Implications of Emerging Technologies**:\n   - Legal issues are the shadow that looms over many innovative projects. Consider [Cardstock](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635049) — its potential to tread on existing IP rights is a stark reminder of the legal minefields in tech. Navigating these waters requires a keen awareness of what’s at stake.\n\n### Surprising Themes: Unexpected Insights or Connections\n\n1. **The Nostalgic Appeal of Older Technologies**:\n   - Who'd have thought that a programmer would find solace in a typewriter? Yet that's exactly what's happening as seen in [I'm a Programmer Who Bought a Typewriter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660042). It’s a fascinating commentary on how some developers are yearning for a distraction-free, focused environment—an antidote to the noise of modern tech.\n\n2. **Educational Potential of Game Engines**:\n   - The [Factorio Blueprint Visualizer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42644168) isn't just for game fans. It doubles as an educational tool, offering a visual way to grasp complex systems. This exemplifies how game engines have untapped potential beyond mere entertainment.\n\n3. **Community-Driven Development and Support**:\n   - The story of [LunchMoney](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42602900) is a testament to the power of community. Built by a solo developer, its success underscores how crucial user feedback and community engagement are in refining and evolving tech products.\n\n### Overall Sentiment\n\nThe vibe among developers is cautiously optimistic. There's a palpable excitement about new frontiers, backed by a strong community ethos. Still, there's no ignoring the elephant in the room: issues around privacy, performance, and ethics remain thorny challenges. The trick is balancing the urge to innovate with a sense of responsibility—a dance that continues to define the tech discourse.",

Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>.

Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>.

If you’ve ever wondered whether your website images have alt text or if you&#x27;re struggling to keep track of all your images for accessibility, we’ve got just the thing.<p>We created an Image Alt Text Checker that quickly scans your website and tells you if any images are missing alt text. It’s super easy to use—just drop your website URL, and the tool does the rest. In seconds, you get a report showing which images need alt text, so you can fix them up in no time.<p>We built this tool with accessibility in mind. It’s not just about SEO (though it definitely helps with that too!); it’s about making your site more user-friendly for people who rely on screen readers. And let’s face it, who doesn’t want a more inclusive website, right?<p>It’s 100% free, and honestly, it saves so much time compared to checking each image manually. Anyone else here focusing on website accessibility? Would love to hear your thoughts or any tools you’ve been using to make your site more inclusive!",

Unfortunately the short answer is that there is no cure and there is treatment that might be a cure under development.

This is an area of medicine that is hard for amateurs to learn about, and a neurooncologist has decades more training than their patients. The reality is this is a horrible disease that currently has no cure - and the treatments that work are all complex medicines prescribed by specialists.",

I would be prepared to let it get a little awkward if they don’t get the hint at first<p>- Talking a lot more helped. Since having a baby, I talk to her all the time. I sing and talk loudly and energetically to her to make her laugh. I make up a wide array of characters with voices. This has changed the tone of my voice in that it is now deeper, less strained, and more powerful. I have noticed a difference in my confidence talking to people and how they listen to me.<p>- I noticed a difference in my interactions just after doing Yoga or meditation. Conversation is often about energy, and yoga or meditation can get you more attuned to giving the right amount.<p>- I noticed the less I cared the easier it got. I make sure that I am respectful and acknowledging of people, I am open and receptive to connecting with the right people, but it’s not my mission to be entertaining or interesting to others.<p>- If I feel like I am giving a lot more to the other person&#x2F;people in the interactions, I start to look elsewhere for people that are more reciprocal with their interactions.<p>- I tried reading books on charisma, small talk, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc. I don’t think any of this actually had much impact or it didn’t resonate with me.

Don&#x27;t over indulge them, but everyone is equal in this world, and hearing them out on things leads to a healthy discourse.<p>One final tip and this is important, if they talk about a trip to the Bahamas or whatever and you then feel the urge to bring up your similar trip to the Bahamas, maybe don&#x27;t. Instead of hearing their point of view, you&#x27;re making the conversation about you immediately and people don&#x27;t like that.

Keep collecting interesting anecdotes. Culture some depth to your personality that is unrelated to work (e.g. interesting hobbies). Essentially train your charisma.<p>2) The big eye opener for me was the discovery that different groups of people actually react differently to me. I.e.

In most tech, the things that catch on are the things that \nare the easiest to develop curriculum for. The shape of a node-based editor like Unity is uniquely suited to explaining over a number of classes. (Source: I had to learn Unity at my University) On the other hand, an engine like raylib can be grokked in an afternoon, so a university-level raylib class wouldn&#x27;t work. So you have all these amateur game developers and programmers coming out of diploma mills, and all they know is Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so companies hire Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so universities teach it, etc. See also: Java being popular. Then of course, all these companies have wildly different needs for their Unity projects, so Unity, being a for-profit company that serves its customers and not a single disgruntled programmer, has to conform their engine. So you end up with &#x27;turbobloat.&#x27; (amazing term, btw)<p>The Half-Life and Morrowind engines are in a unique situation where they&#x27;re put together by enthusiastic programmers who are paid to develop stuff they think is cool. You end up with minimal engines and great tech, suited to the needs of professional game developers.<p>This seems like something that sits in between a raylib and a Unity. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I worry that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do enough to appeal to amateur programmers, but it does too much to appeal to the kind of programmer who wants a smaller engine. I could be very wrong though, I hope to be very wrong. Seems like the performance here is very nice and it&#x27;s very well put together. There&#x27;s definitely a wave of developers coming out frustrated from Unity right now.

                    "text": "I&#x27;ve spent 15 years building a career in robotics&#x2F;software engineering along the &quot;traditional path&quot;: writing software to solve problems, mastering fundamentals, and architecting complex systems. I stay on top of cutting-edge technologies to stay relevant, but I’ve mostly seen AI&#x2F;LLMs as powerful tools for augmenting specific tasks rather than fundamentally reshaping engineering as a discipline.<p>However, NVIDIA’s recent CES keynote was another data point in a growing list challenging that view. While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences. I lack the resources to test these claims in depth, so I’m turning to HN for firsthand insights—not sales pitches or market hype.<p>If you’re using NVIDIA’s AI tools (like NeMo, Omniverse, COSMOS, etc.) or broadly working with LLMs&#x2F;multi-modal AI in your daily work or business, I’d love to know:<p>- What are you actually achieving with them?<p>- What are their limitations? Where do they fall short?<p>- What&#x27;s the reliability of the results? Demo-worthy Deployment-ready for high-stakes environments?<p>- Are the challenges you encounter just a matter of “more compute&#x2F;money,” or are they fundamental barriers?<p>- Do these tools help you reach production faster compared to traditional methods?<p>- Anything else you think may be interesting.<p>I’m looking for honest, real-world insights from those at the front lines of these technologies.",

This generation improves their accuracy and more heavily leans on the technologies to continue performance improvements. AMD is also making the same investments in their silicon putting considerable space to their AI cores and Ray tracing and not much at all to prior compute or rasterisation.<p>They are either right and its just a matter of more data and more compute thrown at the problem and its going to get indistinguishable from pixels more traditionally rendered or they are going to waste considerable silicon on the problem and it never becomes convincing. Even though its got problems DLSS3 has been quite popular for gamers and below perfect in these example are fine the errors aren&#x27;t very consequential.<p>I don&#x27;t know where this goes. I do know each generation of AI has improved quite a lot and we no longer talk about the turing test, we definitely took a jump but there remains a lot of hard engineering problems in every domain of AI to make it function as we want it to. Feels to me like a lot of these generators are in the uncanny valley, they are making the sort of errors that are weird and creepy but the thing is about that valley is it hides a lot of the progress being made.",

Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.

Now based on that information you can try to suss out the overall dynamic and form a theory of impact.  What are you trying to impact?  Do you want to do the things you apparently need to do to make that impact?  What is your exit plan if you find yourself in bad positions?  What kind of bad positions can you imagine being put in, how do you today wish to see yourself handle it?<p>My point is that I rarely don&#x27;t regret (for my careers sake) jumping in and delivering (obvious to me heh heh)  value right away because I see the code I see where it ought to be  and the new boss is really eager to see somethin, but I&#x27;m steamrolling toes and throwing elbows in eyes that I was entirely unaware of.  I guarantee the people you will work with do not see you as a senior for some time, any misstep is a case against your status, its better to move slowly and thoughtfully with regard to politics than try to lightning strike some progress in the hopes it gets noticed 3 levels above you (they don&#x27;t give one shit you already shot your wad can you do it again? and again? and again?)",

I’ve upscaled 60,000 cards from the entire catalog of Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, &amp; a newer game, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com</a>. I&#x27;ve made it easy to build a decklist, download it, and then print at home. Modern inkjet printers got really good when nobody was looking. While it’s clear they’re not real cards, the upscaling makes them look great for casual play (these are not tournament legal). It’s totally free, give it a try!<p>Supplies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies</a>\nPrinter Settings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings</a>\nInstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions</a><p>Overview: I built Cardstock because I had some scripts to do this lying around, and wanted to explore the new Rails 8 magic. Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

Since then, computers were part of my life, significantly. I stare at my screen almost whole day. One day there was some voice in me saying &quot;Buy a typewriter&quot;. I listened to the voice and bought Smith Corona Silent from 1946. It was the most profound experience I ever had with some kind of machine. I was not so happy when I got my first cell phone, and later smartphone nor computer. This is something different, probably because the basics are the same, I&#x27;m still typing.<p>Suddenly I found myself writing a diary, and a novel. I never wrote anything other than blog posts (many of them since I had website similar to The Verge) - which I sold later.<p>I now have 3 typewriters, 2x Smith Corona Silent (1946 and 1956), and Olympia Monica (I think it&#x27;s from &#x27;70).<p>What I found very interesting is that writing on a typewriter is perfectly synchronized with how fast my mind is working. Time slows down! I read that on the web somewhere, and it is slowing the time when you type on a typewriter! I can confess that!<p>My fingers are too fast on computer keyboard, and I even don&#x27;t want to talk about distractions like auto correct and other stuff that always pops up.

So I wanted a way to pretty-print PGN files using a CLI and integrating in my editor.<p>Today, it looks like most people use GUI-based software. So I decided to create a Prettier plugin that formats PGN files. Prettier is a well-known pretty-printer in the Node.js ecosystem, used to ensure consistent source code formatting in software projects. One upside of implementing this PGN formatter as a Prettier plugin is that it benefits from its editor integration.<p>The plugin is currently near complete, even if the project is still at an early stage. It&#x27;s usable, even if there might be some bugs.<p>Hope you find this useful. Comments and ideas are welcome. Have a nice weekend.",

I now have the suspicion that the issue I&#x27;m having isn&#x27;t the tooling, but the process. The solution I&#x27;ve stuck with the longest has been Vikunja, but I felt limited by it as it is strictly a todo application, and doesn&#x27;t support any form of knowledge management (by design, which makes sense!)<p>So I&#x27;m wondering, what processes do people follow for their todo list management and knowledge management? What resources have you learned how to use your applications of choice?<p>My requirements (in rough priority order):<p>- Mobile + Desktop support (PWA, web UI, native application, all fine!)<p>- Searchable<p>- Allows me to keep track of todos with priority ordering and sublists<p>- Allows me to easily capture one-off ideas, as well as expand them into richer, more detailed concepts<p>- FOSS + Self-Hostable<p>The issues I&#x27;ve faced with previous solutions are:<p>- No integration between my todos and knowledge!<p>- Not being able to search<p>- Not being able to quickly capture ideas&#x2F;notes&#x2F;todos<p>- Not having a clean(-ish) UX to navigate between points of info&#x2F;see what my next priorities are",

I won&#x27;t say I really USE this stuff daily, I just play to see what I can do. I&#x27;ve figured out how to pass screenshots back and forth between modals (I have one computer take a screenshot every 30 minutes, and then send that screenshot to another machine, that machine is set up with a mouse hovering over the upload button on perplexity, it uploads the screenshot, and then perplexity does the work from the screenshot) An example of this that worked ok was I had chatgpt create all the themes for the social media schedule I needed to do this year, then I passed that screenshot to perplexity to do the searching on the web, and then I passed that to claud to write the tweet. This actually works ok-ish and I&#x27;m going to expand it a bit over the coming weeks I guess.

Call that use 1. And sometimes you&#x27;re looking back at your spending history needing to make some sense of what has already happened. Call that use 2.<p>For use 1, I have started using Paktol[0], a weirdly-named phone app made by the guys who created ClojureDart[1] (and written in that Clojure dialect). It&#x27;s extremely simple, and that&#x27;s the point. You set a target amount of discretionary spending each day, and it tells you how much you have left or whether you&#x27;re &quot;overdrawn&quot; for the day. That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no categories, no analytics, nothing like that. You just plug in every expense that&#x27;s discretionary and it tells you if you&#x27;re on track. It&#x27;s so simple it <i>almost</i> annoys me that it&#x27;s paid. But it&#x27;s working and no other money tracking app I&#x27;ve ever tried has. It has already paid for itself in better decision-making on my part for having it, so I actually can&#x27;t complain.<p>For the second function, I&#x27;m just using Excel. I have my own cobbled-together categorization system that&#x27;s working well enough, and aside from having to go download transactions manually from my different accounts because they don&#x27;t have an API, the bulk of the categorization work for new entries is automatic (Power Query is very cool).<p>Part of me wonders what an all-in-one solution could look like and I daydream for ten minutes about making one myself. But that never lasts more than a minute or two. There&#x27;s a reason so many have tried and failed.

If you peer into the latest discussions on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), you'll find a few trends that are particularly illuminating right now, both in terms of what's capturing the imagination and what's raising eyebrows.\n\n### Positive Themes: Technologies People Are Excited About\n\n1. **Open Source Tools for Simplifying Complex Processes**:\n   - Take a look at projects like [SimpleGantt](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647668) and [Tinyhnsw](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42625126). These are perfect case studies of how open-source tools are stepping in to make the complex feel manageable. SimpleGantt is a godsend for those in tight regulatory environments who need project management without the bloat. Meanwhile, Tinyhnsw goes the educational route, prioritizing clarity and understanding over sheer speed—a refreshing change in a world obsessed with performance benchmarks.\n\n2. **Combining Old and New Technologies**:\n   - There's something charmingly retro about the revival of Yahoo Pipes ideas in projects like [Mashups](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42609819). It’s a reminder that sometimes the old ways still have a lot to teach us. Similarly, the [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116) is a nod to classic game engines, offering a lean alternative to today’s software behemoths. This is a clear signal that many developers are yearning for simplicity and efficiency.\n\n3. **AI-Powered Enhancements in Everyday Tools**:\n   - AI is weaving its way into the fabric of our daily tools. Look at [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942) — it’s bringing AI into browser automation, simplifying what used to be tedious tasks. However, while the potential is vast, the practical challenges of adoption and utility remain high hurdles to clear.\n\n### Negative Themes: Concerns and Criticisms\n\n1. **Privacy and Data Management in AI Tools**:\n   - Privacy is like the elephant in the room when it comes to AI. [Open Rewind](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42596607) has sparked debates about how personal data is managed, especially in the cloud. The consensus is clear: if your tool isn’t prioritizing encryption and local storage, expect wary users.\n\n2. **Performance Versus Readability in Educational Tools**:\n   - There's always a tug-of-war between readability and performance.
