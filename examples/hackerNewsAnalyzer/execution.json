                      "title": "Show HN: New search engine and free-FOIA-by-fax-via-web for US veteran records",
                      "text": "Hi HN. I&#x27;m the president and founder of a small non-profit called Reclaim The Records that identifies historical and genealogical materials and data sets held by government agencies, archives, and libraries -- and then returns them to the public domain, for free public use.<p>Back in September 2017, our organization made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) asking for a copy of a database they maintain called &quot;BIRLS&quot;, which stands for the Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem. While it&#x27;s not exactly an index of every single post-Civil-War veteran of every branch of the US military, it&#x27;s possibly the closest thing that exists to it.<p>BIRLS is a database that indexes all the known-to-the-VA-in-or-after-the-1970s *<i>veterans&#x27; benefits claims files*</i>, also called C-Files or sometimes XC-Files. Older veterans&#x27; claims files have been moved to the National Archives (NARA), such as the famous Civil War pension files. But 95% of the later benefits claim files, from the late nineteenth century up to today, are still held at the VA, in their warehouses, and still haven&#x27;t been sent to NARA.<p>And even if you know these files exist, the VA really doesn&#x27;t make it easy to get them. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) group within the VA only seems to accept FOIA requests for copies of C-Files by fax (!) and also seems to have made up a whole new rule whereby you have to have an actual wet ink signature on your FOIA request, not just a typed letter.<p>Well, seven years and one very successful FOIA lawsuit in SDNY against the VA later, we at Reclaim The Records are very proud to announce the acquisition and first-ever free public release of the BIRLS database, AND that we built a new website to make the data freely and easily searchable AND that we even built a free FOIA-by-FAX-API system (with a signature widget, to get around the dumb new not-FOIA rules!) built into our website&#x27;s search results, that makes it much, much easier for people to finally get these files out of the VA warehouses and into your mailbox. :-)<p>We also added the ability to do searches through the data for soundalike names, abbreviated names, common nicknames, wildcards, searches by date of birth or death, or ranges of birth and death years, or search by SSN, or by branch(es) of services, or by gender...<p>For a lot more information about our FOIA lawsuit against the VA for the database, including copies of our court papers and the SDNY judge&#x27;s order:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes-online-with-eighteen-million-us-veteran-records-and-free-foia-by-fax-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes...</a><p>As for the tech stuff, actually building the website, the search engine, and its FOIAing capability...well, it has been a pretty fun project to build.<p>The BIRLS dataset was eventually provided to us by the VA (several years after we originally asked for it...) as a large zip file which, when decompressed via the command line, yielded the hilarious file name of *<i>Redacted_Full.csv*</i>. I then loaded the cleaned CSV data into a MySQL database, and then used a modified version of the Apache Solr search engine to index the data, so that it could become searchable by soundalike names (using Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching), nicknames (using Solr&#x27;s synonyms feature), partial names (using wildcards), with dates converted to ISO 8601 format to enable both exact date and date range searches, and various other search criteria.<p>The front-end of the website is built with Nuxt and hosted on Digital Ocean&#x27;s App Platform, with backups of the FOIA request data on the cloud storage service Wasabi. The fax interface for submitting FOIA requests is powered by the Notifyre API. We use Mailchimp to send e-mail newsletters, and their product Mandrill for programmatic e-mail sending. We use Sentry for error monitoring, Better Stack for server logging, and TinyBird to collect FOIA submission analytics.<p>Enjoy!",

This was inspired by a previous project that ran Tetris in a PDF. The author utilized old versions of Emscripten to compile C to asm.js code compatible with the limited JavaScript runtime in a PDF engine, specifically Chromium-based browsers using PDFium. The display is achieved by updating ASCII characters to create a 6-color monochrome display. The source code is available on GitHub.\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n- An author of another similar project, \"PDF Tetris,\" shared their own version of \"PDF Doom,\" acknowledging the neatness of the presented version (0 points).\n- Comments humorously remarked on the extent of technological capability, with one suggesting a future where full operating systems might run inside PDFs using similar techniques (0 points).\n- A commenter nostalgically recalled their experiences with PDFs and Emacs, pondering the potential for running Doom in Emacs using ASCII characters (0 points).\n- The integration of Doom and another popular post, \"Bad Apple,\" was noted, highlighting the synergy between recent creative projects on Hacker News (0 points).\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- The post received significant interest with a score of 290 points, indicating strong community engagement and intrigue.\n- Comment sentiment was light-hearted and positive, with users expressing amazement and humor at the creative technical achievement.\n- The comments were mostly in agreement and playful, with no significant debate or contention, reflecting a consensus of appreciation for the cleverness and technical prowess of the project."

However, there are common requests for enhancements, such as supporting GPX files without timing data and integrating with other platforms like Strava. Some users express a desire for additional features, such as real-time 3D models, to boost user engagement and sharing potential. There is also a call for ease of deployment through tools like Docker. The comments indicate that while users see value in the tool, they are also looking for practical improvements and integrations to enhance its utility. The sentiment around cost concerns, particularly in relation to Strava, highlights a sensitivity to pricing models for such features. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660255)"

It seeks anecdotal insights on average PR review durations and whether expectations around these times are realistic.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n1. **Variable Review Times:** Comments reveal that PR review times vary significantly depending on the complexity of the PR and the reviewer’s workload. Simple changes can be reviewed quickly, while more complex PRs may take days (comment score: 0).\n2. **Trust and Productivity:** Some engineers bypass the PR process due to established trust, with reviews becoming a formality. This suggests that PRs often serve more as compliance checks than collaborative improvements (comment score: 0).\n3. **Impact of Organizational Culture:** Company culture and incentives play a significant role in PR review times. In some environments, PRs are not valued in performance metrics, leading to delays (comment score: 0).\n\n**Notable Discussion Points:**\n- **Reviewer Dynamics:** The readiness of a reviewer to engage can depend on their flow state, with some prioritizing reviews when they reach natural breaks in their work (comment score: 0).\n- **Team Practices:** Effective teams establish guidelines to ensure timely reviews, setting expectations such as a one-day review standard (comment score: 0).\n- **Collaboration Timing:** Some commenters suggest that meaningful collaboration should occur before the PR stage, reducing the need for extensive reviews post-commit (comment score: 0).\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- **Post Score:** The post received a score of 30 points, indicating moderate community interest.\n- **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** The comments reflect a wide range of experiences and emphasize the importance of context in PR review processes. Although all comments have a score of 0, they provide diverse perspectives on the factors affecting PR review times.\n- **Level of Debate or Consensus:** There is no strong consensus, but a recurring theme is the variability in review times due to organizational practices and individual reviewer behaviors, highlighting the complexity of establishing standardized expectations for PR reviews."

Most insightful: \"The biggest issue with PR reviews in my experience is not how long they take, but the justifications people provide for their feedback.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion on Hacker News about pull request (PR) reviews reveals a significant level of frustration among developers regarding the inefficiency and inconsistencies in the PR review process. Several commenters point out that the process is often seen as a compliance mechanism rather than a collaborative effort to improve code quality. Many have experienced delays, sometimes spanning weeks, and feel compelled to navigate organizational politics to get their changes approved. The sentiment that PR reviews often serve more as gatekeeping than genuine collaboration is echoed in comments describing \"rubber-stamping\" and the existence of reviewer cliques. There is also a shared belief that meaningful collaboration should occur earlier in the development process rather than being deferred to the PR stage. However, some comments suggest solutions, such as setting clear team guidelines for review timelines to improve efficiency. Despite the diversity of experiences, the overall tone indicates a need for better organizational practices to streamline the PR review process and enhance its value.

Several comments emphasize the importance of understanding and complying with regulations like HIPAA, suggesting legal consultation as a necessary step before proceeding. There is also concern about the app's security and the developer's understanding of these regulations. The community appears to agree on the need for legal compliance, as reflected by the consistent advice to seek legal counsel. However, there is a nuanced discussion regarding the applicability of HIPAA, suggesting a divide in understanding or interpretation of the law. Additionally, there is an appreciation for the app's concept, recognizing the need for patient-centered solutions in healthcare, though skepticism remains about its implementation and legal handling.

                      "text": "I am excited to announce the release of TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that delivers state-of-the-art predictions on small datasets in just 2.8 seconds for classification and 4.8 seconds for regression compared to strong baselines tuned for 4 hours. Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>. You can also try it via API: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client</a><p>TabPFN v2 is trained on 130 million synthetic tabular prediction datasets to perform in-context learning and output a predictive distribution for the test data points. Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

The comments indicate appreciation for the project's potential while also questioning its limitations, such as the 10,000 sample threshold and the use of synthetic data. There is interest in how TabPFN compares to other models like SVMs and GBDTs, with some skepticism about its claims. Several comments request more details on implementation aspects, such as handling larger datasets and the availability of training data and code. The sentiment is positive, with users eager to explore the project's applications, particularly in business and real-world settings. However, there is a call for further validation against natural datasets to assess real-world performance beyond synthetic scenarios. The uniform score of zero suggests a balanced engagement without any comment standing out significantly, pointing to a community keen on exploration and feedback rather than controversy or strong consensus.

People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

                      "text": "Hi HN! I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

                      "text": "Bin is an AI business intelligence analyst that turns data into dashboards. Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>. Please do let us know what you think – we’re open to feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve Bin.",

The tool is positioned as a cost-effective solution for companies needing tailored dashboards without the need for technical staff.\n\n**Notable Discussion Points:**\n1. **Domain Usage Concerns (0 points):** A commenter points out that the use of the .new TLD for Bin's website might violate Google's usage policy, which could lead to losing the domain.\n   \n2. **AI and BI Integration (0 points):** Another commenter suggests that the focus should be on creating a new BI product with AI as an integration, rather than the other way around, citing the saturation of AI-focused BI tools.\n\n3. **Market and Competition (0 points):** There are mentions of the crowded AI analytics space and the challenge of competing with established BI tools like PowerBI.\n\n4. **Product Feedback (0 points):** Users have provided feedback regarding the integration capabilities and database support, emphasizing the importance of clear documentation and sign-up processes.\n\n5. **Naming Suggestions (0 points):** A suggestion was made to consider a different name for the product, as \"bin\" is commonly associated with a directory in Linux.\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- **Post Score of 59 points** indicates a moderate level of interest and engagement from the Hacker News community.\n- **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** The comments reflect a mix of constructive criticism and curiosity, with users interested in the concept but concerned about practical implementation and market positioning.\n- **Level of Debate or Consensus:** While there is no strong consensus, several comments raise valid concerns about domain policy, market saturation, and product positioning, suggesting room for improvement in these areas."

Most upvoted: \"The only data I care about on the phone already gets backed up by Google and is then exported regularly via Google Takeout. I don't live on my phone so I tend not to generate much of any value on it other than random pictures of things. Prior to Google automatically backing up everything, I used Titanium Backup.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"Having switched phones a couple of months ago, there didn’t seem to be a good option. Either you need to have root - which means that most banking apps won’t work anymore -, you need to backup to the cloud which a) not every app supports and b) I don’t want to do for more private data, or you need to use the backup API that however some apps also don’t support. It’s a mess and I don’t understand that Google hasn’t fixed that.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"My device is rooted and I use NeoBackup to backup apps with all their data (including what the app developer marked as 'should not be backed up', often data that they would like you to backup on their own cloud instead). Syncthing synchronises these backups to my home server automatically, as well as the phone's user data (photos, mainly). The photos are additionally sent to Photoprism. I avoid Google’s cloud as much as I can.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion reveals diverse approaches to backing up mobile data, with some users preferring Google’s built-in options, while others avoid it due to privacy concerns. The community appears divided between those who trust cloud solutions like Google and those who prefer self-managed backups using tools like NeoBackup and Syncthing. The lack of a universally satisfactory backup method is a source of frustration, notably for users who cannot root their devices without losing certain app functionalities, such as banking apps. The comments reflect a consensus that while multiple backup solutions exist, none are perfect, and privacy remains a significant concern for many. The zero scores across all comments suggest an even distribution of interest or agreement, with no particular comment standing out in terms of community endorsement.

His doctors stopped prescribing, so he found it elsewhere, and got a bad batch with fentanyl.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"I know when someone’s faced with certain death they’ll do almost anything they can to survive if only for a little bit longer, but this thread full of personal antectodes and largely non-reproduced effects from random pubmed articles is the hackernews equivalent of essential oils or smth.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"You should ask them if they want you playing doctor. I have a chronic disease, not fatal, and totally manageable. But the most annoying thing is when someone finds out and suddenly pretends to be the expert.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion centers on offering support to friends with glioblastoma, with a strong emphasis on skepticism towards unverified treatments. Commenters agree on the importance of providing practical help and seeking reputable medical treatment, as shown by the suggestion to connect patients with top medical centers or clinical trials. There is a notable concern about the susceptibility of patients to scams, which aligns with the community's caution against non-scientific remedies. The most controversial comment highlights the tension between hope in novel treatments and reliance on anecdotal evidence, reflecting a broader skepticism towards unverified claims. Overall, comments suggest a consensus on prioritizing verified medical advice and support networks. The thread illustrates a compassionate yet critical approach to dealing with terminal illness, with an undercurrent of frustration at the limitations of current treatments.

Then of course, all these companies have wildly different needs for their Unity projects, so Unity, being a for-profit company that serves its customers and not a single disgruntled programmer, has to conform their engine. So you end up with &#x27;turbobloat.&#x27; (amazing term, btw)<p>The Half-Life and Morrowind engines are in a unique situation where they&#x27;re put together by enthusiastic programmers who are paid to develop stuff they think is cool. You end up with minimal engines and great tech, suited to the needs of professional game developers.<p>This seems like something that sits in between a raylib and a Unity. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I worry that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do enough to appeal to amateur programmers, but it does too much to appeal to the kind of programmer who wants a smaller engine. I could be very wrong though, I hope to be very wrong. Seems like the performance here is very nice and it&#x27;s very well put together. There&#x27;s definitely a wave of developers coming out frustrated from Unity right now. As the nostalgia cycle moves to the 2000&#x27;s, there&#x27;s a very real demand to play and create games that are no more graphically complex than Half-Life 2.<p>Anyway, great project. Great web design. Documentation is written in a nice voice.",

Multiple editors working around a single data file spec is also a cool idea!

Commenters expressed appreciation for the Tramway project as an alternative, highlighting its minimalistic design and potential to appeal to frustrated developers tired of complex engines. There is a consensus disapproving of the \"turbobloat\" in mainstream engines, with a call for more efficient and sustainable software development practices. Some comments suggest that educational systems contribute to this issue by focusing on popular yet cumbersome tools. The sentiment is overall positive towards projects like Tramway, which offer streamlined alternatives and challenge the status quo. The conversation reflects a desire for more focused and efficient game development tools. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116)"

                      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed over the years that whenever I&#x27;m in group conversations in a social setting, people in general don&#x27;t pay too much attention to what I say. For example, let&#x27;s say the group is talking about travel and someone says something I find relatable e.g. someone mentions a place I&#x27;ve been to and really liked. When I try to contribute to the conversation, people just don&#x27;t seem interested, and typically the conversation moves on as if I hadn&#x27;t said anything. If I try to speak for a longer time (continuing with the travel example, let&#x27;s say I try to talk about a particular attraction I enjoyed visiting at that location), I&#x27;m usually interrupted, and the focus shifts to whoever interrupted me.<p>This has happened (and still happens often) a lot, in different social circles, with people of diverse backgrounds. So, I figure it&#x27;s not that I hang out with rude people, the problem must be me. I think the saddest part of all this is that even my wife&#x27;s attention drifts off most of the time I try to talk to her.<p>I know it&#x27;s not a language barrier issue, and I know for sure I enunciate my words well. I wonder though if the issue may be that I have a weak voice, or just an overall weak presence&#x2F;body language. How can that be improved, if that&#x27;s the case?",

This has changed the tone of my voice in that it is now deeper, less strained, and more powerful. I have noticed a difference in my confidence talking to people and how they listen to me.<p>- I noticed a difference in my interactions just after doing Yoga or meditation. Conversation is often about energy, and yoga or meditation can get you more attuned to giving the right amount.<p>- I noticed the less I cared the easier it got. I make sure that I am respectful and acknowledging of people, I am open and receptive to connecting with the right people, but it’s not my mission to be entertaining or interesting to others.<p>- If I feel like I am giving a lot more to the other person&#x2F;people in the interactions, I start to look elsewhere for people that are more reciprocal with their interactions.<p>- I tried reading books on charisma, small talk, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc. I don’t think any of this actually had much impact or it didn’t resonate with me.

Most insightful: \"Reminder that sometimes empty alt text is _more_ accessible, in particular for images that have no bearing on the main subject of the page\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion centers around the potential use of AI, specifically GPT-4, to automate the generation of alt text for images. This suggestion is seen as a time-saving measure that could also meet regulatory requirements. However, an insightful counterpoint is made regarding accessibility: sometimes, leaving alt text empty is more beneficial, particularly when images are irrelevant to the page's main content. Both comments received a score of 0, indicating a neutral stance from the community without strong agreement or disagreement. The insights provided emphasize a balanced consideration of AI's role in accessibility, highlighting both potential benefits and limitations.

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.  It helps get more people on your side.<p>ADKAR change management model<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar</a>",

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked. Not to mention that type of proactivity in and of itself impressed a lot of people; doing things for clout is dumb but making things you learn public and synthesizing them into a form that&#x27;s accessible to others is an important hallmark of a senior in my opinion.<p>Ask SO many questions. Got opaque docs that are important? Ask for a quick meeting with the person who wrote them to make sure your understanding is crystal clear.

Here are a few things that worked well for me in the past:<p>Learning Key Information: Start by documenting key processes, tech stacks, and team dynamics. One way I did this was by using a knowledge management system (even a simple Google Doc or Notion can work wonders). This helps to ensure you&#x27;re not just absorbing information but also actively organizing it for future reference.<p>Causing a Good Impression: Approach the first few days with humility—understand that every team has its own rhythm and established dynamics. Don&#x27;t rush to make big changes; instead, focus on learning and understanding.<p>Positioning Yourself for Impact: Focus on building trust. Ask smart questions, help where you can without overstepping, and showcase your leadership by sharing knowledge or identifying small wins.<p>Balancing Team Adaptation vs. Not Absorbing Bad Patterns: It’s crucial to observe first and understand the team’s way of working, then slowly suggest improvements without coming across as a disruptor. Find opportunities where your experience can naturally enhance existing workflows without causing friction.<p>Leadership with Less Business Context: Leverage your technical expertise, but be transparent about your learning curve in terms of the business context. Lead by example—help others see that you&#x27;re willing to learn the business side while providing guidance on the technical aspects.<p>On another note, for anyone who wants to stand out in a team or on your company profile, consider using custom avatars for your profile pictures. A personalized, minimalistic custom avatar can make your digital presence more memorable. I created Presentra, a service that transforms your photo into a stylized digital avatar, ideal for professional settings (especially when onboarding or establishing your presence).<p>If anyone’s looking for an easy way to get a custom avatar, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;</a>",

Why do you think something is different, why did some things stay the same?  Repeat.  You will naturally come into contact with most important people trying to get access to everything, where does it go fast, where does it go slow?  Who didn&#x27;t you come in contact with? Who gives bad information?  Who gives useless information?  Who gives good information, where is their source?

I guarantee the people you will work with do not see you as a senior for some time, any misstep is a case against your status, its better to move slowly and thoughtfully with regard to politics than try to lightning strike some progress in the hopes it gets noticed 3 levels above you (they don&#x27;t give one shit you already shot your wad can you do it again? and again? and again?)",

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.  It helps get more people on your side.<p>ADKAR change management model<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar</a>",

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked. Not to mention that type of proactivity in and of itself impressed a lot of people; doing things for clout is dumb but making things you learn public and synthesizing them into a form that&#x27;s accessible to others is an important hallmark of a senior in my opinion.<p>Ask SO many questions. Got opaque docs that are important? Ask for a quick meeting with the person who wrote them to make sure your understanding is crystal clear. Abandoning ego and being a knowledge sponge makes such a huge difference.",

                        "text": "Great question! Transitioning into a senior position can be challenging, but a deliberate approach can make a world of difference. Here are a few things that worked well for me in the past:<p>Learning Key Information: Start by documenting key processes, tech stacks, and team dynamics. One way I did this was by using a knowledge management system (even a simple Google Doc or Notion can work wonders). This helps to ensure you&#x27;re not just absorbing information but also actively organizing it for future reference.<p>Causing a Good Impression: Approach the first few days with humility—understand that every team has its own rhythm and established dynamics. Don&#x27;t rush to make big changes; instead, focus on learning and understanding.<p>Positioning Yourself for Impact: Focus on building trust. Ask smart questions, help where you can without overstepping, and showcase your leadership by sharing knowledge or identifying small wins.<p>Balancing Team Adaptation vs. Not Absorbing Bad Patterns: It’s crucial to observe first and understand the team’s way of working, then slowly suggest improvements without coming across as a disruptor. Find opportunities where your experience can naturally enhance existing workflows without causing friction.<p>Leadership with Less Business Context: Leverage your technical expertise, but be transparent about your learning curve in terms of the business context. Lead by example—help others see that you&#x27;re willing to learn the business side while providing guidance on the technical aspects.<p>On another note, for anyone who wants to stand out in a team or on your company profile, consider using custom avatars for your profile pictures. A personalized, minimalistic custom avatar can make your digital presence more memorable. I created Presentra, a service that transforms your photo into a stylized digital avatar, ideal for professional settings (especially when onboarding or establishing your presence).<p>If anyone’s looking for an easy way to get a custom avatar, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;</a>",

Try to make no impact, as close to zero as possible.  Two weeks later try again to assess who does what.  Does it agree.  Who changed?  Why do you think something is different, why did some things stay the same?  Repeat.  You will naturally come into contact with most important people trying to get access to everything, where does it go fast, where does it go slow?  Who didn&#x27;t you come in contact with? Who gives bad information?  Who gives useless information?  Who gives good information, where is their source? Now based on that information you can try to suss out the overall dynamic and form a theory of impact.  What are you trying to impact?

Most upvoted: \"Keep lab notes! I keep detailed daily notes of what I’ve learned...\"\n2. Most controversial: \"It is surprising that this still happens, but I’ve had senior engineers...\"\n3. Most insightful: \"What not to do: 1. Disrespect current processes...\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion primarily revolves around the best practices for transitioning into a senior technical role within a company. The community largely agrees that respecting existing processes, taking time to understand the current system, and building strong relationships within the team are critical. There is also consensus on the importance of documenting processes and asking questions to gain a deeper understanding, as highlighted in the most insightful comment. The most controversial comment reflects a common issue where new senior hires suggest drastic changes without fully understanding the context, which aligns with the advice against making immediate changes. Overall, the comments suggest a balanced approach, emphasizing observation and learning before implementing changes. Despite all comments having a score of 0, the detailed and practical nature of the advice suggests community engagement and utility. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656184)"

                      "text": "Trading cards are awesome, but paying $30 for some cardboard isn’t. I’ve upscaled 60,000 cards from the entire catalog of Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, &amp; a newer game, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com</a>. I&#x27;ve made it easy to build a decklist, download it, and then print at home. Modern inkjet printers got really good when nobody was looking. While it’s clear they’re not real cards, the upscaling makes them look great for casual play (these are not tournament legal). It’s totally free, give it a try!<p>Supplies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies</a>\nPrinter Settings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings</a>\nInstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions</a><p>Overview: I built Cardstock because I had some scripts to do this lying around, and wanted to explore the new Rails 8 magic. Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

I stay on top of cutting-edge technologies to stay relevant, but I’ve mostly seen AI&#x2F;LLMs as powerful tools for augmenting specific tasks rather than fundamentally reshaping engineering as a discipline.<p>However, NVIDIA’s recent CES keynote was another data point in a growing list challenging that view. While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences. I lack the resources to test these claims in depth, so I’m turning to HN for firsthand insights—not sales pitches or market hype.<p>If you’re using NVIDIA’s AI tools (like NeMo, Omniverse, COSMOS, etc.) or broadly working with LLMs&#x2F;multi-modal AI in your daily work or business, I’d love to know:<p>- What are you actually achieving with them?<p>- What are their limitations? Where do they fall short?<p>- What&#x27;s the reliability of the results? Demo-worthy Deployment-ready for high-stakes environments?<p>- Are the challenges you encounter just a matter of “more compute&#x2F;money,” or are they fundamental barriers?<p>- Do these tools help you reach production faster compared to traditional methods?<p>- Anything else you think may be interesting.<p>I’m looking for honest, real-world insights from those at the front lines of these technologies.",

The commenter suggests using Godot to create functionalities like pivot tables and charts.\n- Another comment (0 points) notes that Godot's GUI uses its game engine features for its editor, suggesting its feasibility for desktop applications. They mention a low-processor mode to reduce resource usage in non-game applications.\n- One comment (0 points) argues that game engines are suitable for highly dynamic UIs but may require more effort and resources for typical applications. Game engines continually re-render, unlike static app UIs.\n- A commenter (0 points) suggests exploring the idea despite the risks, as graphical application development remains imperfect, and new approaches could potentially enhance human-computer interaction.\n- Concerns about accessibility were raised (0 points), indicating that game engine-based UIs could exclude users with accessibility needs.\n- Several comments provided examples of existing applications and frameworks that utilize similar concepts, like EVE Online and Andy.works.\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- **Post Score:** The post received a score of 20 points, indicating a moderate level of community interest.\n- **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** Comments were evenly scored at 0 points, suggesting a neutral reception without any strong community consensus or disagreement.\n- **Level of Debate or Consensus:** There was a variety of perspectives shared, but no clear consensus emerged.

Most upvoted: \"I have been toying with that idea for years. Game engines are the only truly-cross-platform UIs out there. They're fast, extremely flexible.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"That would make accessibility hard and you'd be excluding a lot of people who could've otherwise used your product.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"For truly novel UIs with high dynamism it is probably a good decision. For anything else it is almost certainly more work for the dev and more resource-intensive for the system.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion presents a variety of perspectives on using game engines like Godot for developing non-game applications. The comments reflect a mix of enthusiasm and caution. Some participants are intrigued by the potential of novel, dynamic UIs that game engines can provide, recognizing their flexibility and cross-platform capabilities (e.g., Comment 1). However, there are concerns about resource intensity and the challenge of making applications that feel native to system apps. The comment highlighting accessibility issues (Comment 2) suggests a significant concern that could hinder the adoption of this approach for broader audiences. Moreover, the conversation touches on the practicality of using game engines versus more traditional frameworks like Electron for typical applications, emphasizing the importance of user experience (Comment 3). Overall, while there is interest in the innovative potential of game engines for UI, practical considerations around resource usage and accessibility remain pivotal in the community's evaluation of this approach.

So I wanted a way to pretty-print PGN files using a CLI and integrating in my editor.<p>Today, it looks like most people use GUI-based software. So I decided to create a Prettier plugin that formats PGN files. Prettier is a well-known pretty-printer in the Node.js ecosystem, used to ensure consistent source code formatting in software projects. One upside of implementing this PGN formatter as a Prettier plugin is that it benefits from its editor integration.<p>The plugin is currently near complete, even if the project is still at an early stage. It&#x27;s usable, even if there might be some bugs.<p>Hope you find this useful. Comments and ideas are welcome. Have a nice weekend.",

While it&#x27;s not exactly an index of every single post-Civil-War veteran of every branch of the US military, it&#x27;s possibly the closest thing that exists to it.<p>BIRLS is a database that indexes all the known-to-the-VA-in-or-after-the-1970s *<i>veterans&#x27; benefits claims files*</i>, also called C-Files or sometimes XC-Files. Older veterans&#x27; claims files have been moved to the National Archives (NARA), such as the famous Civil War pension files. But 95% of the later benefits claim files, from the late nineteenth century up to today, are still held at the VA, in their warehouses, and still haven&#x27;t been sent to NARA.<p>And even if you know these files exist, the VA really doesn&#x27;t make it easy to get them. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) group within the VA only seems to accept FOIA requests for copies of C-Files by fax (!) and also seems to have made up a whole new rule whereby you have to have an actual wet ink signature on your FOIA request, not just a typed letter.<p>Well, seven years and one very successful FOIA lawsuit in SDNY against the VA later, we at Reclaim The Records are very proud to announce the acquisition and first-ever free public release of the BIRLS database, AND that we built a new website to make the data freely and easily searchable AND that we even built a free FOIA-by-FAX-API system (with a signature widget, to get around the dumb new not-FOIA rules!) built into our website&#x27;s search results, that makes it much, much easier for people to finally get these files out of the VA warehouses and into your mailbox. :-)<p>We also added the ability to do searches through the data for soundalike names, abbreviated names, common nicknames, wildcards, searches by date of birth or death, or ranges of birth and death years, or search by SSN, or by branch(es) of services, or by gender...<p>For a lot more information about our FOIA lawsuit against the VA for the database, including copies of our court papers and the SDNY judge&#x27;s order:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes-online-with-eighteen-million-us-veteran-records-and-free-foia-by-fax-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes...</a><p>As for the tech stuff, actually building the website, the search engine, and its FOIAing capability...well, it has been a pretty fun project to build.<p>The BIRLS dataset was eventually provided to us by the VA (several years after we originally asked for it...) as a large zip file which, when decompressed via the command line, yielded the hilarious file name of *<i>Redacted_Full.csv*</i>. I then loaded the cleaned CSV data into a MySQL database, and then used a modified version of the Apache Solr search engine to index the data, so that it could become searchable by soundalike names (using Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching), nicknames (using Solr&#x27;s synonyms feature), partial names (using wildcards), with dates converted to ISO 8601 format to enable both exact date and date range searches, and various other search criteria.<p>The front-end of the website is built with Nuxt and hosted on Digital Ocean&#x27;s App Platform, with backups of the FOIA request data on the cloud storage service Wasabi. The fax interface for submitting FOIA requests is powered by the Notifyre API. We use Mailchimp to send e-mail newsletters, and their product Mandrill for programmatic e-mail sending. We use Sentry for error monitoring, Better Stack for server logging, and TinyBird to collect FOIA submission analytics.<p>Enjoy!",

Does anybody have any recommendations on how to find someone?<p>Comments on terms of use, etc:  Yes, this needs to be done, but I figured the terms of use are of no use until there&#x27;s something to use.<p>Comments on &quot;novice&quot; and &quot;learning projects&quot;:  Yes this was absolutely built with love and grand intentions, and no, I&#x27;m not a novice. I wrote this because my adult daughter died of cancer recently, and we really could have used this. If I can help others deal with the pain of diseases like this, then I&#x27;m going to try.  I&#x27;ll work through the problems as they come up.<p>Aside from the security audit, I&#x27;m also looking for someone who&#x27;ll do a much more professional design and L&amp;F for the site.<p>Another issue I can really use advice on is how to show this to the people who need it.  People who aren&#x27;t dealing with the problem right now, aren&#x27;t interested.  How do I reach the maybe 5% to 10% of people who have the need right now?",

                    "text": "I am excited to announce the release of TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that delivers state-of-the-art predictions on small datasets in just 2.8 seconds for classification and 4.8 seconds for regression compared to strong baselines tuned for 4 hours. Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>.

Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>.

In most tech, the things that catch on are the things that \nare the easiest to develop curriculum for. The shape of a node-based editor like Unity is uniquely suited to explaining over a number of classes. (Source: I had to learn Unity at my University) On the other hand, an engine like raylib can be grokked in an afternoon, so a university-level raylib class wouldn&#x27;t work. So you have all these amateur game developers and programmers coming out of diploma mills, and all they know is Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so companies hire Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so universities teach it, etc. See also: Java being popular. Then of course, all these companies have wildly different needs for their Unity projects, so Unity, being a for-profit company that serves its customers and not a single disgruntled programmer, has to conform their engine. So you end up with &#x27;turbobloat.&#x27; (amazing term, btw)<p>The Half-Life and Morrowind engines are in a unique situation where they&#x27;re put together by enthusiastic programmers who are paid to develop stuff they think is cool. You end up with minimal engines and great tech, suited to the needs of professional game developers.<p>This seems like something that sits in between a raylib and a Unity. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I worry that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do enough to appeal to amateur programmers, but it does too much to appeal to the kind of programmer who wants a smaller engine. I could be very wrong though, I hope to be very wrong. Seems like the performance here is very nice and it&#x27;s very well put together. There&#x27;s definitely a wave of developers coming out frustrated from Unity right now. As the nostalgia cycle moves to the 2000&#x27;s, there&#x27;s a very real demand to play and create games that are no more graphically complex than Half-Life 2.<p>Anyway, great project. Great web design. Documentation is written in a nice voice.",

I have noticed a difference in my confidence talking to people and how they listen to me.<p>- I noticed a difference in my interactions just after doing Yoga or meditation. Conversation is often about energy, and yoga or meditation can get you more attuned to giving the right amount.<p>- I noticed the less I cared the easier it got. I make sure that I am respectful and acknowledging of people, I am open and receptive to connecting with the right people, but it’s not my mission to be entertaining or interesting to others.<p>- If I feel like I am giving a lot more to the other person&#x2F;people in the interactions, I start to look elsewhere for people that are more reciprocal with their interactions.<p>- I tried reading books on charisma, small talk, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc. I don’t think any of this actually had much impact or it didn’t resonate with me.

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked. Not to mention that type of proactivity in and of itself impressed a lot of people; doing things for clout is dumb but making things you learn public and synthesizing them into a form that&#x27;s accessible to others is an important hallmark of a senior in my opinion.<p>Ask SO many questions.

Here are a few things that worked well for me in the past:<p>Learning Key Information: Start by documenting key processes, tech stacks, and team dynamics. One way I did this was by using a knowledge management system (even a simple Google Doc or Notion can work wonders). This helps to ensure you&#x27;re not just absorbing information but also actively organizing it for future reference.<p>Causing a Good Impression: Approach the first few days with humility—understand that every team has its own rhythm and established dynamics. Don&#x27;t rush to make big changes; instead, focus on learning and understanding.<p>Positioning Yourself for Impact: Focus on building trust. Ask smart questions, help where you can without overstepping, and showcase your leadership by sharing knowledge or identifying small wins.<p>Balancing Team Adaptation vs. Not Absorbing Bad Patterns: It’s crucial to observe first and understand the team’s way of working, then slowly suggest improvements without coming across as a disruptor. Find opportunities where your experience can naturally enhance existing workflows without causing friction.<p>Leadership with Less Business Context: Leverage your technical expertise, but be transparent about your learning curve in terms of the business context. Lead by example—help others see that you&#x27;re willing to learn the business side while providing guidance on the technical aspects.<p>On another note, for anyone who wants to stand out in a team or on your company profile, consider using custom avatars for your profile pictures. A personalized, minimalistic custom avatar can make your digital presence more memorable. I created Presentra, a service that transforms your photo into a stylized digital avatar, ideal for professional settings (especially when onboarding or establishing your presence).<p>If anyone’s looking for an easy way to get a custom avatar, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;</a>",

                    "text": "Trading cards are awesome, but paying $30 for some cardboard isn’t. I’ve upscaled 60,000 cards from the entire catalog of Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, &amp; a newer game, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com</a>. I&#x27;ve made it easy to build a decklist, download it, and then print at home. Modern inkjet printers got really good when nobody was looking. While it’s clear they’re not real cards, the upscaling makes them look great for casual play (these are not tournament legal). It’s totally free, give it a try!<p>Supplies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies</a>\nPrinter Settings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings</a>\nInstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions</a><p>Overview: I built Cardstock because I had some scripts to do this lying around, and wanted to explore the new Rails 8 magic. Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences.

So I wanted a way to pretty-print PGN files using a CLI and integrating in my editor.<p>Today, it looks like most people use GUI-based software. So I decided to create a Prettier plugin that formats PGN files. Prettier is a well-known pretty-printer in the Node.js ecosystem, used to ensure consistent source code formatting in software projects. One upside of implementing this PGN formatter as a Prettier plugin is that it benefits from its editor integration.<p>The plugin is currently near complete, even if the project is still at an early stage. It&#x27;s usable, even if there might be some bugs.<p>Hope you find this useful. Comments and ideas are welcome. Have a nice weekend.",
