                      "title": "Show HN: New search engine and free-FOIA-by-fax-via-web for US veteran records",
                      "text": "Hi HN. I&#x27;m the president and founder of a small non-profit called Reclaim The Records that identifies historical and genealogical materials and data sets held by government agencies, archives, and libraries -- and then returns them to the public domain, for free public use.<p>Back in September 2017, our organization made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) asking for a copy of a database they maintain called &quot;BIRLS&quot;, which stands for the Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem. While it&#x27;s not exactly an index of every single post-Civil-War veteran of every branch of the US military, it&#x27;s possibly the closest thing that exists to it.<p>BIRLS is a database that indexes all the known-to-the-VA-in-or-after-the-1970s *<i>veterans&#x27; benefits claims files*</i>, also called C-Files or sometimes XC-Files. Older veterans&#x27; claims files have been moved to the National Archives (NARA), such as the famous Civil War pension files. But 95% of the later benefits claim files, from the late nineteenth century up to today, are still held at the VA, in their warehouses, and still haven&#x27;t been sent to NARA.<p>And even if you know these files exist, the VA really doesn&#x27;t make it easy to get them. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) group within the VA only seems to accept FOIA requests for copies of C-Files by fax (!) and also seems to have made up a whole new rule whereby you have to have an actual wet ink signature on your FOIA request, not just a typed letter.<p>Well, seven years and one very successful FOIA lawsuit in SDNY against the VA later, we at Reclaim The Records are very proud to announce the acquisition and first-ever free public release of the BIRLS database, AND that we built a new website to make the data freely and easily searchable AND that we even built a free FOIA-by-FAX-API system (with a signature widget, to get around the dumb new not-FOIA rules!) built into our website&#x27;s search results, that makes it much, much easier for people to finally get these files out of the VA warehouses and into your mailbox. :-)<p>We also added the ability to do searches through the data for soundalike names, abbreviated names, common nicknames, wildcards, searches by date of birth or death, or ranges of birth and death years, or search by SSN, or by branch(es) of services, or by gender...<p>For a lot more information about our FOIA lawsuit against the VA for the database, including copies of our court papers and the SDNY judge&#x27;s order:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes-online-with-eighteen-million-us-veteran-records-and-free-foia-by-fax-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes...</a><p>As for the tech stuff, actually building the website, the search engine, and its FOIAing capability...well, it has been a pretty fun project to build.<p>The BIRLS dataset was eventually provided to us by the VA (several years after we originally asked for it...) as a large zip file which, when decompressed via the command line, yielded the hilarious file name of *<i>Redacted_Full.csv*</i>. I then loaded the cleaned CSV data into a MySQL database, and then used a modified version of the Apache Solr search engine to index the data, so that it could become searchable by soundalike names (using Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching), nicknames (using Solr&#x27;s synonyms feature), partial names (using wildcards), with dates converted to ISO 8601 format to enable both exact date and date range searches, and various other search criteria.<p>The front-end of the website is built with Nuxt and hosted on Digital Ocean&#x27;s App Platform, with backups of the FOIA request data on the cloud storage service Wasabi. The fax interface for submitting FOIA requests is powered by the Notifyre API. We use Mailchimp to send e-mail newsletters, and their product Mandrill for programmatic e-mail sending. We use Sentry for error monitoring, Better Stack for server logging, and TinyBird to collect FOIA submission analytics.<p>Enjoy!",

However, there is significant concern over data privacy, particularly regarding the exposure of sensitive information like Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Several comments question the safety and legality of making such data public, pointing out the potential risks of identity theft or misuse. The community seems divided on the issue of public access versus privacy, with no clear consensus due to all comments having a score of 0, indicating a balanced view on both sides. The comment about the lack of clear motivation for the project points to a need for better communication to prevent assumptions of malintent. Overall, the dialogue reflects a balance between valuing open access to historical records and safeguarding personal information. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048)"

I used the doomgeneric (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ozkl&#x2F;doomgeneric\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ozkl&#x2F;doomgeneric</a>) fork of the original Doom source, as that made writing the IO fairly easy. All I had to do was implement a framebuffer and keyboard inputs.<p>Unlike previous interactive PDF demos, the output for DoomPDF is achieved by creating a text field for each row of pixels in the screen, then setting their contents to various ASCII characters. This gives me a 6 color monochrome display, that can be updated reasonably quickly (80ms per frame).<p>The source code is available at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ading2210&#x2F;doompdf\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ading2210&#x2F;doompdf</a><p>Note that this PDF can only run in Chromium-based browsers that use the PDFium engine.",

The project creatively uses text fields for each row of pixels to create a 6-color monochrome display. This PDF-based version of Doom is compatible only with Chromium-based browsers using the PDFium engine.\n\n2. **Notable Discussion Points:**\n   - The author of a similar project, \"PDF Tetris,\" expressed admiration and shared their version of PDF Doom, highlighting community interest in pushing the boundaries of what PDFs can do.\n   - Some comments humorously speculate on the potential for further developments, like embedding a full operating system within a PDF, indicating excitement about the project's implications.\n   - Technical discussions touched on the potential for size optimization using PDF's DEFLATE compression.\n\n3. **Overall Reception:**\n   - **Post Score:** 298 points, demonstrating significant community interest and engagement.\n   - **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** Comments are generally positive and playful, showcasing a community both amused and impressed by the technical feat.\n   - **Level of Debate or Consensus:** There's a consensus of admiration for the creativity and technical achievement, with no significant debate or disagreement in the comments.

As a DA, I mostly wrote aggregation queries, built dashboards, and did some Python, Pandas, and Notebook munging.<p>On the other hand, SWE is a different world. I guess it depends on the type of SWE you are and the nature of the organization you work for. At a large-scale organization, as an SWE, I did far more programming work than I ever did as a DA.<p>That said, there are different ways to cope and build skills—it takes time. I do side projects and, more importantly, write about them regularly [1]. Since I have to publish something each week, it forces me to think about different problems and seek out new technologies to try out so I can write about them. I also write about things I’ve figured out at work, which has been immensely helpful. Over the years, this act of actively seeking knowledge has added up and become substantial.<p>More than once, people have reached out with job offers just because they stumbled across my writing on Hacker News or other social media platforms.<p>Your approach might be different. Find something tangential to programming and work on it outside of work hours. Even a few hours per week adds up. For me, it’s side projects and writing.

As a DA, I mostly wrote aggregation queries, built dashboards, and did some Python, Pandas, and Notebook munging.<p>On the other hand, SWE is a different world. I guess it depends on the type of SWE you are and the nature of the organization you work for. At a large-scale organization, as an SWE, I did far more programming work than I ever did as a DA.<p>That said, there are different ways to cope and build skills—it takes time. I do side projects and, more importantly, write about them regularly [1]. Since I have to publish something each week, it forces me to think about different problems and seek out new technologies to try out so I can write about them. I also write about things I’ve figured out at work, which has been immensely helpful. Over the years, this act of actively seeking knowledge has added up and become substantial.<p>More than once, people have reached out with job offers just because they stumbled across my writing on Hacker News or other social media platforms.<p>Your approach might be different. Find something tangential to programming and work on it outside of work hours. Even a few hours per week adds up. For me, it’s side projects and writing.

Most insightful: \"The biggest issue with PR reviews in my experience is not how long they take, but the justifications people provide for their feedback.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion highlights a widespread dissatisfaction with pull request (PR) review processes, emphasizing variability in review times and effectiveness across different organizations. Many commenters agree that reviews are often seen as a form of gatekeeping rather than a genuine collaborative effort to improve code quality. The most insightful comment points out that the quality of feedback is more critical than the speed of reviews, suggesting that meaningful justifications for changes should be prioritized. The most controversial comment challenges the value of PR reviews altogether, suggesting that experienced engineers often bypass them due to their perceived inefficiency. This perspective indicates a potential disconnect between official processes and practical developer workflows. The lack of votes on comments suggests a diverse range of opinions without a clear consensus. To improve PR processes, commenters suggest better-defined guidelines and more constructive feedback mechanisms. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656621)"

The app is nearly complete and open for beta testing. The creator seeks feedback and emphasizes the app is independent of any medical institutions.\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n\n1. **Legal Concerns**: Several comments highlight potential legal issues, particularly regarding HIPAA compliance, suggesting the need for a legal review to navigate regulations on handling personal health information (PHI). One comment (0 points) mentions that HIPAA might not apply directly unless a covered entity is involved, but stresses the importance of readiness to engage with such entities legally.\n\n2. **Privacy and Security**: Many commenters express concern about the app's handling of private data, urging the developer to ensure a solid privacy policy and security measures. A commenter (0 points) stresses the necessity of a comprehensive security audit.\n\n3. **App Viability and Purpose**: While there are criticisms regarding the app's potential overlap with existing services like MyChart (0 points), one comment (0 points) appreciates the idea but suggests it needs more iterations for effective implementation.\n\n4. **Developer's Motivation and Expertise**: The developer addresses criticisms by clarifying motivations rooted in personal experience and asserts not being a novice, despite some comments suggesting the project might reflect a beginner's approach.\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n\n- **Post Score**: With 158 points, the post indicates significant interest and engagement from the Hacker News community.\n- **Comment Sentiment**: The sentiment in comments is mixed, with a strong focus on legal and privacy concerns. The reception reflects a cautious but interested perspective from the community.\n- **Debate and Consensus**: There is a consensus on the importance of addressing legal and security issues, with less focus on debating the app's usefulness, which some acknowledge positively despite the challenges."

Most insightful: \"HIPAA rules apply to covered entities, and the developer of this app does not appear to be a covered entity.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion predominantly revolves around the legal and privacy implications of handling personal health information (PHI) in the app being discussed. Multiple comments emphasize the need for legal consultation and caution against potential HIPAA violations, reflecting a shared concern about regulatory compliance. The sentiment is largely cautious, with users advising the original poster to take down the app until legal frameworks are clearly understood and implemented. One insightful comment clarifies the applicability of HIPAA, suggesting that while the developer may not be directly liable, engaging with covered entities would necessitate compliance. There is also a recognition of the app's potential value in the healthcare system, but this is tempered by the substantial legal risks involved. The community consensus, indicated by the uniform score of 0 across comments, suggests that while the idea has merit, the execution is fraught with legal complexities that must be addressed. \n\n[Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42646922)"

One user appreciates the user interface and the unique approach to highlighting unhelpful thought patterns, indicating a recognition of the app's potential. However, a critical comment questions the privacy claims regarding data storage and the use of third-party services like OpenAI and Google Analytics, highlighting potential trust issues. The third comment seems to be an attempt at humor but does not contribute constructively to the discussion. The equal scoring of comments suggests no strong consensus, though the critical comment raises significant privacy concerns that may resonate with privacy-conscious users.

                      "text": "I am excited to announce the release of TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that delivers state-of-the-art predictions on small datasets in just 2.8 seconds for classification and 4.8 seconds for regression compared to strong baselines tuned for 4 hours. Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>. You can also try it via API: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client</a><p>TabPFN v2 is trained on 130 million synthetic tabular prediction datasets to perform in-context learning and output a predictive distribution for the test data points. Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck.

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

This sets the tone for the entire discussion, emphasizing the intersection of personal stories and larger historical contexts. While no comment received upvotes, indicating no clear consensus, the diversity in book topics—from containerized shipping to espionage—suggests a broad curiosity about significant technological and historical narratives. The mention of works like \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\" and \"Skunk Works\" shows an appreciation for detailed explorations of complex subjects. The comment on \"velocity\" and execution, despite its lack of score, could be seen as controversial due to its directive tone and emphasis on practicality over narrative.

                      "text": "Hi HN! I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

It aims to make automation easier and more robust against changes in the DOM, without building a full agent, thus maintaining developer control.\n\n**Notable Discussion Points:**\n- A suggestion (0 points) was made to incorporate a feature that allows Stagehand to return XPath elements when extracting data, providing a fallback to traditional scraping methods if needed.\n- Some users (0 points) expressed concerns about using LLMs in runtime environments, suggesting Stagehand might be better suited for generating deterministic code.\n- The challenge of interacting with sites using invisible captchas was mentioned (0 points), as they can detect automation scripts like Playwright.\n- The potential for compiling Stagehand scripts into actual DOM operations to avoid relying on LLMs for every run was questioned (0 points).\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- **Post Score:** The post received 322 points, indicating significant community interest.\n- **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** Comments are generally positive but lack high engagement scores. They reflect curiosity and appreciation for Stagehand's potential while also highlighting practical concerns and suggestions for improvement.\n- **Level of Debate or Consensus:** There is a mild debate on the practicality of using LLMs in production, but overall, the comments suggest a consensus that Stagehand is a promising tool with room for further development and adaptation to user needs."

                      "text": "Bin is an AI business intelligence analyst that turns data into dashboards. Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>. Please do let us know what you think – we’re open to feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve Bin.",

Most controversial: \"AI focused new BI products are a wash, your focus should be a new BI product with maybe an AI integration (Not the other way around), or an AI integration to an existing BI product.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"The .new TLD is very restrictive, it is intended to be used for launching a new something, e.g: docs.new creates a new Google Doc.

The .new TLD is managed by Google and they do enforce this requirement.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion reflects a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism regarding the newly launched product. Several commenters congratulate the launch and express interest, but there are concerns about the product's scope and integration capabilities. The comment regarding the .new TLD highlights potential compliance issues, pointing out a misunderstanding of TLD usage requirements. Another insightful comment critiques the strategy of focusing on AI within BI products, suggesting that the market is becoming saturated and recommending a more balanced integration approach. Technical questions about database support and integration underline a need for clearer documentation and feature transparency to attract potential users. Overall, the community's feedback underscores the importance of strategic focus and clear communication of technical capabilities. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612237)"

Most upvoted: \"Native dark mode is not worth the effort in most cases. There are extensions that you can use to do it yourself if you want.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"dang mentioned HN would rather implement full custom CSS first, which I strongly disagree with.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"I prefer sites not to implement a custom dark mode and instead to make sure their styles invert well, less work for devs, more consistency for me.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion centers around the implementation of dark mode on Hacker News, with a consensus leaning towards using browser extensions rather than expecting native support. Several comments suggest that extensions offer a flexible and user-controlled solution, minimizing the development burden on website creators. The sentiment reflects a practical approach to user interface preferences, where custom styling is deemed less essential. Notably, one comment referencing a past discussion highlights a disagreement with the site's priorities, indicating a desire for more community-driven solutions. The absence of upvotes across all comments suggests a lack of strong community engagement or consensus on the issue. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42675389)"

The author seeks advice on biohacks that may have worked for others.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n1. The post highlights desperation for alternative treatments outside standard medical practices due to the severity of the diagnosis.\n2. A magnetic helmet that purportedly uses oscillating magnetic fields to kill cancer cells is considered, but there is skepticism about its scientific validity.\n\n**Notable Discussion Points:**\n- A notable comment (0 points) suggests prioritizing traditional medical resources such as finding a skilled brain surgeon and exploring clinical trials.\n- Another comment (0 points) warns against relying on anecdotal evidence and stresses the importance of well-researched medical practices.\n- A comment (0 points) advises against offering unqualified medical advice, emphasizing the need to respect the patient's wishes and established treatment plans.\n- Concerns were raised (0 points) about the potential for exploitation by individuals selling unverified treatments.\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- The post's score of 153 points indicates significant community interest, likely due to the serious nature of the topic.\n- Comments reflect a mix of empathy, caution, and skepticism towards unconventional treatments, with no clear consensus on the efficacy of the suggested biohacks.\n- The discussion shows a preference for conventional medical advice and highlights the challenges of dealing with a terminal illness like GBM."

Most upvoted: \"Here’s a summary of all of the current treatments and near future treatments for GBM/glioma: https://docs.google.com/file/d/1kTa3eamaL91Smjh9r_0CYv5OYFX4fPK3/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"You should ask them if they want you playing doctor. I have a chronic disease, not fatal, and totally manageable. But the most annoying thing is when someone finds out and suddenly pretends to be the expert.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"Don&#x27;t let them fall into the false hope of &quot;I might have 5-10 more years&quot;. The person I knew fell into that and did absolutely nothing they wanted to do before they died because they were in denial and kept holding onto the expectation that they&#x27;d get better.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion revolves around dealing with terminal brain cancer, focusing on potential treatments and personal anecdotes. There is a mix of skepticism and hope, with some commenters cautioning against false hope and unverified treatments, while others share alternative therapies and resources. The community doesn't show a clear consensus due to the lack of comment scores, indicating diverse opinions on the best approach to supporting a friend with terminal illness. A significant point of tension is whether to take non-professional advice seriously, as seen in the most controversial comment, which warns against unsolicited medical advice.

The SDK is described as a low-budget, open-source alternative to mainstream game engines, optimized for modern hardware but with an old-school feel. The creator, dissatisfied with current engine options, developed this in response to growing \"turbobloat\" in software, aiming for a lightweight and efficient solution.\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n- A recurring theme in comments is the critique of \"turbobloat\" in modern software, which refers to unnecessary features that slow down performance, necessitating more powerful hardware. This sentiment resonates with multiple users (various comments, 0 points).\n- The discussion highlights a nostalgia for simpler, more optimized engines like those used in Half-Life and Morrowind, contrasting with contemporary engines like Unity and Unreal, which are seen as bloated (0 points).\n- Some commenters express interest in the project's potential for developing low-poly or minimalist games, noting its appeal over more complex engines (0 points).\n- A user appreciates the accessible \"Getting Started\" page, indicating good documentation and ease of learning (0 points).\n\n**Overall Reception:**\n- **Post Score:** The high score of 654 points reflects strong community interest, likely due to the innovative approach and nostalgia factor.\n- **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** Comments are generally positive, expressing enthusiasm for the project's promise and critique of current game engine bloat. However, no comment stands out with significant upvotes, indicating either a lack of consensus or a broader distribution of interest across various points.\n- **Level of Debate or Consensus:** While sentiment is largely supportive of the project and its philosophy against \"turbobloat,\" comments suggest a diversity of perspectives on what constitutes bloat and how best to address it in game development."

Most upvoted: \"Some might say 'just get a better computer'. This is why getting a better computer is bad...\" (Took the words from my mouth. What a great project.)\n2. Most controversial: \"You reference 'Turbobloat' and engines being 'bloated' - which is to some extent fair. But it is maybe worth describing what that means to you...\"\n3. Most insightful: \"I replayed Half-life 2 recently and was struck, even without high-res texture packs, how amazing the game still looks today.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion is centered around the theme of software \"Turbobloat,\" with commenters expressing agreement on the negative impact of bloated software on older hardware and the environment. There is a shared sentiment that simpler, more efficient engines like those from the past are preferable, as exemplified by mentions of Half-Life and Morrowind. The community seems to appreciate the project being discussed, as it aligns with a desire for streamlined, efficient software. However, there is a call for clearer definitions of what constitutes \"bloat\" in the context of the project. Comments reflect a blend of nostalgia for older software paradigms and enthusiasm for new projects that challenge current industry norms. The sentiment is generally positive, with a focus on the project's potential impact and the quality of its documentation. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116)"

                      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed over the years that whenever I&#x27;m in group conversations in a social setting, people in general don&#x27;t pay too much attention to what I say. For example, let&#x27;s say the group is talking about travel and someone says something I find relatable e.g. someone mentions a place I&#x27;ve been to and really liked. When I try to contribute to the conversation, people just don&#x27;t seem interested, and typically the conversation moves on as if I hadn&#x27;t said anything. If I try to speak for a longer time (continuing with the travel example, let&#x27;s say I try to talk about a particular attraction I enjoyed visiting at that location), I&#x27;m usually interrupted, and the focus shifts to whoever interrupted me.<p>This has happened (and still happens often) a lot, in different social circles, with people of diverse backgrounds. So, I figure it&#x27;s not that I hang out with rude people, the problem must be me. I think the saddest part of all this is that even my wife&#x27;s attention drifts off most of the time I try to talk to her.<p>I know it&#x27;s not a language barrier issue, and I know for sure I enunciate my words well. I wonder though if the issue may be that I have a weak voice, or just an overall weak presence&#x2F;body language. How can that be improved, if that&#x27;s the case?",

If you’ve ever wondered whether your website images have alt text or if you&#x27;re struggling to keep track of all your images for accessibility, we’ve got just the thing.<p>We created an Image Alt Text Checker that quickly scans your website and tells you if any images are missing alt text. It’s super easy to use—just drop your website URL, and the tool does the rest. In seconds, you get a report showing which images need alt text, so you can fix them up in no time.<p>We built this tool with accessibility in mind. It’s not just about SEO (though it definitely helps with that too!); it’s about making your site more user-friendly for people who rely on screen readers. And let’s face it, who doesn’t want a more inclusive website, right?<p>It’s 100% free, and honestly, it saves so much time compared to checking each image manually.

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.  It helps get more people on your side.<p>ADKAR change management model<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar</a>",

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked. Not to mention that type of proactivity in and of itself impressed a lot of people; doing things for clout is dumb but making things you learn public and synthesizing them into a form that&#x27;s accessible to others is an important hallmark of a senior in my opinion.<p>Ask SO many questions. Got opaque docs that are important? Ask for a quick meeting with the person who wrote them to make sure your understanding is crystal clear.

Here are a few things that worked well for me in the past:<p>Learning Key Information: Start by documenting key processes, tech stacks, and team dynamics. One way I did this was by using a knowledge management system (even a simple Google Doc or Notion can work wonders). This helps to ensure you&#x27;re not just absorbing information but also actively organizing it for future reference.<p>Causing a Good Impression: Approach the first few days with humility—understand that every team has its own rhythm and established dynamics. Don&#x27;t rush to make big changes; instead, focus on learning and understanding.<p>Positioning Yourself for Impact: Focus on building trust. Ask smart questions, help where you can without overstepping, and showcase your leadership by sharing knowledge or identifying small wins.<p>Balancing Team Adaptation vs. Not Absorbing Bad Patterns: It’s crucial to observe first and understand the team’s way of working, then slowly suggest improvements without coming across as a disruptor. Find opportunities where your experience can naturally enhance existing workflows without causing friction.<p>Leadership with Less Business Context: Leverage your technical expertise, but be transparent about your learning curve in terms of the business context. Lead by example—help others see that you&#x27;re willing to learn the business side while providing guidance on the technical aspects.<p>On another note, for anyone who wants to stand out in a team or on your company profile, consider using custom avatars for your profile pictures. A personalized, minimalistic custom avatar can make your digital presence more memorable. I created Presentra, a service that transforms your photo into a stylized digital avatar, ideal for professional settings (especially when onboarding or establishing your presence).<p>If anyone’s looking for an easy way to get a custom avatar, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;</a>",

Why do you think something is different, why did some things stay the same?  Repeat.  You will naturally come into contact with most important people trying to get access to everything, where does it go fast, where does it go slow?  Who didn&#x27;t you come in contact with? Who gives bad information?  Who gives useless information?  Who gives good information, where is their source? Now based on that information you can try to suss out the overall dynamic and form a theory of impact.  What are you trying to impact?

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.  It helps get more people on your side.<p>ADKAR change management model<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar</a>",

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked. Not to mention that type of proactivity in and of itself impressed a lot of people; doing things for clout is dumb but making things you learn public and synthesizing them into a form that&#x27;s accessible to others is an important hallmark of a senior in my opinion.<p>Ask SO many questions. Got opaque docs that are important? Ask for a quick meeting with the person who wrote them to make sure your understanding is crystal clear. Abandoning ego and being a knowledge sponge makes such a huge difference.",

Here are a few things that worked well for me in the past:<p>Learning Key Information: Start by documenting key processes, tech stacks, and team dynamics. One way I did this was by using a knowledge management system (even a simple Google Doc or Notion can work wonders). This helps to ensure you&#x27;re not just absorbing information but also actively organizing it for future reference.<p>Causing a Good Impression: Approach the first few days with humility—understand that every team has its own rhythm and established dynamics. Don&#x27;t rush to make big changes; instead, focus on learning and understanding.<p>Positioning Yourself for Impact: Focus on building trust. Ask smart questions, help where you can without overstepping, and showcase your leadership by sharing knowledge or identifying small wins.<p>Balancing Team Adaptation vs. Not Absorbing Bad Patterns: It’s crucial to observe first and understand the team’s way of working, then slowly suggest improvements without coming across as a disruptor. Find opportunities where your experience can naturally enhance existing workflows without causing friction.<p>Leadership with Less Business Context: Leverage your technical expertise, but be transparent about your learning curve in terms of the business context. Lead by example—help others see that you&#x27;re willing to learn the business side while providing guidance on the technical aspects.<p>On another note, for anyone who wants to stand out in a team or on your company profile, consider using custom avatars for your profile pictures. A personalized, minimalistic custom avatar can make your digital presence more memorable. I created Presentra, a service that transforms your photo into a stylized digital avatar, ideal for professional settings (especially when onboarding or establishing your presence).<p>If anyone’s looking for an easy way to get a custom avatar, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;</a>",

                      "text": "Trading cards are awesome, but paying $30 for some cardboard isn’t. I’ve upscaled 60,000 cards from the entire catalog of Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, &amp; a newer game, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com</a>. I&#x27;ve made it easy to build a decklist, download it, and then print at home. Modern inkjet printers got really good when nobody was looking. While it’s clear they’re not real cards, the upscaling makes them look great for casual play (these are not tournament legal). It’s totally free, give it a try!<p>Supplies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies</a>\nPrinter Settings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings</a>\nInstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions</a><p>Overview: I built Cardstock because I had some scripts to do this lying around, and wanted to explore the new Rails 8 magic. Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences. I lack the resources to test these claims in depth, so I’m turning to HN for firsthand insights—not sales pitches or market hype.<p>If you’re using NVIDIA’s AI tools (like NeMo, Omniverse, COSMOS, etc.) or broadly working with LLMs&#x2F;multi-modal AI in your daily work or business, I’d love to know:<p>- What are you actually achieving with them?<p>- What are their limitations? Where do they fall short?<p>- What&#x27;s the reliability of the results? Demo-worthy Deployment-ready for high-stakes environments?<p>- Are the challenges you encounter just a matter of “more compute&#x2F;money,” or are they fundamental barriers?<p>- Do these tools help you reach production faster compared to traditional methods?<p>- Anything else you think may be interesting.<p>I’m looking for honest, real-world insights from those at the front lines of these technologies.",

But if you look closely, you'll see patterns that reveal what really matters to software engineers, especially those in startups where innovation isn't just a buzzword—it's the lifeblood. Let's take a closer look at some themes emerging from recent top posts on Hacker News, the digital agora where developers gather to share and scrutinize ideas.\n\n## The Bright Spots: What’s Getting People Excited\n\n1. **Democratizing Data**: Projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048) embody a powerful trend: making information more accessible. Think of it as a modern-day equivalent of the public library, but on a digital scale. By creating a free search engine for US veteran records, this initiative is part of a larger movement to use technology to tear down the walls that keep data locked away.\n\n2. **Tech with a Twist**: Then there's [PDF Doom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754). This isn't just a game; it's a delightful hack that reimagines what a PDF can do. It's like discovering your old bicycle can fly. This playful approach not only entertains but also sparks curiosity about how we can use existing technologies in fresh, unexpected ways.\n\n3. **AI in the Trenches**: Take [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942), which brings AI and automation to web development. It's the software equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, streamlining mundane tasks so developers can focus on what really counts—innovation. This trend reflects a deeper desire to make our tools work smarter, not harder.\n\n## The Shadows: Areas of Concern\n\n1. **Guarding Privacy**: With projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048), the flip side of transparency is privacy. The debate here is age-old: how do we balance the public good against individual privacy? The fear is that in our rush to open up data, we might expose sensitive information, like Social Security Numbers, to those with less noble intentions.\n\n2. **Fighting Software Bloat**: Enter the critique of \"turbobloat\" in projects such as [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116). It's as if software has become the digital equivalent of a Swiss chalet—beautiful but unnecessarily ornate. Developers yearn for simplicity, for software that does just enough and no more, without sacrificing performance on the altar of features.\n\n3. **AI’s Reliability Gap**: We've long heard promises of AI's transformative power, but as the discussions following Nvidia's CES keynote [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808) remind us, there's often a chasm between hype and reality.

Imagine textbooks that are not only read but experienced interactively, turning learning into an adventure rather than a chore.\n\n2. **Boundary-Breaking Tools**: The buzz around [HipScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623593) shows a promising cross-pollination of ideas. This tool, which runs CUDA in browsers, isn't just a boon for web developers; it's a game-changer for performing complex computations like machine learning directly in the browser. It’s like discovering your car can also sail.\n\n3. **Nostalgia as Innovation**: Finally, the enthusiasm for [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116) reveals a surprising trend: a longing for the simplicity of older technology. It’s not just nostalgia—it’s a recognition that sometimes the old ways, stripped of modern bloat, can be more effective.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nThe sentiment among developers is one of cautious optimism. There's a palpable excitement about the new tools and technologies on the horizon, but it's tempered by a vigilant awareness of the pitfalls—privacy issues, software inefficiency, and the sometimes shaky bridge between AI's promise and its practical application.

                        "report": "In the swirling cauldron of technology trends, it's easy to get caught up in the froth and miss the substance. But if you look closely, you'll see patterns that reveal what really matters to software engineers, especially those in startups where innovation isn't just a buzzword—it's the lifeblood. Let's take a closer look at some themes emerging from recent top posts on Hacker News, the digital agora where developers gather to share and scrutinize ideas.\n\n## The Bright Spots: What’s Getting People Excited\n\n1. **Democratizing Data**: Projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048) embody a powerful trend: making information more accessible. Think of it as a modern-day equivalent of the public library, but on a digital scale. By creating a free search engine for US veteran records, this initiative is part of a larger movement to use technology to tear down the walls that keep data locked away.\n\n2. **Tech with a Twist**: Then there's [PDF Doom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754). This isn't just a game; it's a delightful hack that reimagines what a PDF can do. It's like discovering your old bicycle can fly. This playful approach not only entertains but also sparks curiosity about how we can use existing technologies in fresh, unexpected ways.\n\n3. **AI in the Trenches**: Take [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942), which brings AI and automation to web development. It's the software equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, streamlining mundane tasks so developers can focus on what really counts—innovation. This trend reflects a deeper desire to make our tools work smarter, not harder.\n\n## The Shadows: Areas of Concern\n\n1. **Guarding Privacy**: With projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048), the flip side of transparency is privacy. The debate here is age-old: how do we balance the public good against individual privacy? The fear is that in our rush to open up data, we might expose sensitive information, like Social Security Numbers, to those with less noble intentions.\n\n2. **Fighting Software Bloat**: Enter the critique of \"turbobloat\" in projects such as [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116). It's as if software has become the digital equivalent of a Swiss chalet—beautiful but unnecessarily ornate. Developers yearn for simplicity, for software that does just enough and no more, without sacrificing performance on the altar of features.\n\n3. **AI’s Reliability Gap**: We've long heard promises of AI's transformative power, but as the discussions following Nvidia's CES keynote [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808) remind us, there's often a chasm between hype and reality. AI, for all its potential, is still in its awkward adolescence, prone to errors that require human oversight.\n\n## The Surprises: Where We Didn’t Expect to Find Gold\n\n1. **Gaming Meets Learning**: The ingenious use of PDFs in gaming, demonstrated by [PDF Doom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754), hints at untapped potential in education. Imagine textbooks that are not only read but experienced interactively, turning learning into an adventure rather than a chore.\n\n2. **Boundary-Breaking Tools**: The buzz around [HipScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623593) shows a promising cross-pollination of ideas. This tool, which runs CUDA in browsers, isn't just a boon for web developers; it's a game-changer for performing complex computations like machine learning directly in the browser. It’s like discovering your car can also sail.\n\n3. **Nostalgia as Innovation**: Finally, the enthusiasm for [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116) reveals a surprising trend: a longing for the simplicity of older technology. It’s not just nostalgia—it’s a recognition that sometimes the old ways, stripped of modern bloat, can be more effective.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nThe sentiment among developers is one of cautious optimism. There's a palpable excitement about the new tools and technologies on the horizon, but it's tempered by a vigilant awareness of the pitfalls—privacy issues, software inefficiency, and the sometimes shaky bridge between AI's promise and its practical application. The community is alive with debate, driven by a desire to build solutions that don’t just innovate but also endure.",

                    "report": "In the swirling cauldron of technology trends, it's easy to get caught up in the froth and miss the substance. But if you look closely, you'll see patterns that reveal what really matters to software engineers, especially those in startups where innovation isn't just a buzzword—it's the lifeblood. Let's take a closer look at some themes emerging from recent top posts on Hacker News, the digital agora where developers gather to share and scrutinize ideas.\n\n## The Bright Spots: What’s Getting People Excited\n\n1. **Democratizing Data**: Projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048) embody a powerful trend: making information more accessible. Think of it as a modern-day equivalent of the public library, but on a digital scale. By creating a free search engine for US veteran records, this initiative is part of a larger movement to use technology to tear down the walls that keep data locked away.\n\n2. **Tech with a Twist**: Then there's [PDF Doom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754). This isn't just a game; it's a delightful hack that reimagines what a PDF can do. It's like discovering your old bicycle can fly. This playful approach not only entertains but also sparks curiosity about how we can use existing technologies in fresh, unexpected ways.\n\n3. **AI in the Trenches**: Take [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942), which brings AI and automation to web development. It's the software equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, streamlining mundane tasks so developers can focus on what really counts—innovation. This trend reflects a deeper desire to make our tools work smarter, not harder.\n\n## The Shadows: Areas of Concern\n\n1. **Guarding Privacy**: With projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048), the flip side of transparency is privacy. The debate here is age-old: how do we balance the public good against individual privacy? The fear is that in our rush to open up data, we might expose sensitive information, like Social Security Numbers, to those with less noble intentions.\n\n2. **Fighting Software Bloat**: Enter the critique of \"turbobloat\" in projects such as [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116). It's as if software has become the digital equivalent of a Swiss chalet—beautiful but unnecessarily ornate. Developers yearn for simplicity, for software that does just enough and no more, without sacrificing performance on the altar of features.\n\n3. **AI’s Reliability Gap**: We've long heard promises of AI's transformative power, but as the discussions following Nvidia's CES keynote [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808) remind us, there's often a chasm between hype and reality. AI, for all its potential, is still in its awkward adolescence, prone to errors that require human oversight.\n\n## The Surprises: Where We Didn’t Expect to Find Gold\n\n1. **Gaming Meets Learning**: The ingenious use of PDFs in gaming, demonstrated by [PDF Doom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754), hints at untapped potential in education. Imagine textbooks that are not only read but experienced interactively, turning learning into an adventure rather than a chore.\n\n2. **Boundary-Breaking Tools**: The buzz around [HipScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623593) shows a promising cross-pollination of ideas. This tool, which runs CUDA in browsers, isn't just a boon for web developers; it's a game-changer for performing complex computations like machine learning directly in the browser. It’s like discovering your car can also sail.\n\n3. **Nostalgia as Innovation**: Finally, the enthusiasm for [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116) reveals a surprising trend: a longing for the simplicity of older technology. It’s not just nostalgia—it’s a recognition that sometimes the old ways, stripped of modern bloat, can be more effective.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nThe sentiment among developers is one of cautious optimism. There's a palpable excitement about the new tools and technologies on the horizon, but it's tempered by a vigilant awareness of the pitfalls—privacy issues, software inefficiency, and the sometimes shaky bridge between AI's promise and its practical application. The community is alive with debate, driven by a desire to build solutions that don’t just innovate but also endure.",
                    "tweet": "Old-school simplicity is the new frontier. Developers are ditching bloat for leaner, smarter tools, even as AI flirts with reliability. Innovation isn't just shiny; it's nostalgic, playful, and demands a balance between transparency and privacy. #TechTrends #HackerNews"

I&#x27;m the president and founder of a small non-profit called Reclaim The Records that identifies historical and genealogical materials and data sets held by government agencies, archives, and libraries -- and then returns them to the public domain, for free public use.<p>Back in September 2017, our organization made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) asking for a copy of a database they maintain called &quot;BIRLS&quot;, which stands for the Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem. While it&#x27;s not exactly an index of every single post-Civil-War veteran of every branch of the US military, it&#x27;s possibly the closest thing that exists to it.<p>BIRLS is a database that indexes all the known-to-the-VA-in-or-after-the-1970s *<i>veterans&#x27; benefits claims files*</i>, also called C-Files or sometimes XC-Files. Older veterans&#x27; claims files have been moved to the National Archives (NARA), such as the famous Civil War pension files. But 95% of the later benefits claim files, from the late nineteenth century up to today, are still held at the VA, in their warehouses, and still haven&#x27;t been sent to NARA.<p>And even if you know these files exist, the VA really doesn&#x27;t make it easy to get them. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) group within the VA only seems to accept FOIA requests for copies of C-Files by fax (!) and also seems to have made up a whole new rule whereby you have to have an actual wet ink signature on your FOIA request, not just a typed letter.<p>Well, seven years and one very successful FOIA lawsuit in SDNY against the VA later, we at Reclaim The Records are very proud to announce the acquisition and first-ever free public release of the BIRLS database, AND that we built a new website to make the data freely and easily searchable AND that we even built a free FOIA-by-FAX-API system (with a signature widget, to get around the dumb new not-FOIA rules!) built into our website&#x27;s search results, that makes it much, much easier for people to finally get these files out of the VA warehouses and into your mailbox. :-)<p>We also added the ability to do searches through the data for soundalike names, abbreviated names, common nicknames, wildcards, searches by date of birth or death, or ranges of birth and death years, or search by SSN, or by branch(es) of services, or by gender...<p>For a lot more information about our FOIA lawsuit against the VA for the database, including copies of our court papers and the SDNY judge&#x27;s order:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes-online-with-eighteen-million-us-veteran-records-and-free-foia-by-fax-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;reclaimtherecords&#x2F;the-birls-database-goes...</a><p>As for the tech stuff, actually building the website, the search engine, and its FOIAing capability...well, it has been a pretty fun project to build.<p>The BIRLS dataset was eventually provided to us by the VA (several years after we originally asked for it...) as a large zip file which, when decompressed via the command line, yielded the hilarious file name of *<i>Redacted_Full.csv*</i>. I then loaded the cleaned CSV data into a MySQL database, and then used a modified version of the Apache Solr search engine to index the data, so that it could become searchable by soundalike names (using Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching), nicknames (using Solr&#x27;s synonyms feature), partial names (using wildcards), with dates converted to ISO 8601 format to enable both exact date and date range searches, and various other search criteria.<p>The front-end of the website is built with Nuxt and hosted on Digital Ocean&#x27;s App Platform, with backups of the FOIA request data on the cloud storage service Wasabi. The fax interface for submitting FOIA requests is powered by the Notifyre API. We use Mailchimp to send e-mail newsletters, and their product Mandrill for programmatic e-mail sending. We use Sentry for error monitoring, Better Stack for server logging, and TinyBird to collect FOIA submission analytics.<p>Enjoy!",

Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>. You can also try it via API: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client</a><p>TabPFN v2 is trained on 130 million synthetic tabular prediction datasets to perform in-context learning and output a predictive distribution for the test data points. Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

                    "text": "Bin is an AI business intelligence analyst that turns data into dashboards. Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>. Please do let us know what you think – we’re open to feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve Bin.",

In most tech, the things that catch on are the things that \nare the easiest to develop curriculum for. The shape of a node-based editor like Unity is uniquely suited to explaining over a number of classes. (Source: I had to learn Unity at my University) On the other hand, an engine like raylib can be grokked in an afternoon, so a university-level raylib class wouldn&#x27;t work. So you have all these amateur game developers and programmers coming out of diploma mills, and all they know is Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so companies hire Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so universities teach it, etc. See also: Java being popular. Then of course, all these companies have wildly different needs for their Unity projects, so Unity, being a for-profit company that serves its customers and not a single disgruntled programmer, has to conform their engine. So you end up with &#x27;turbobloat.&#x27; (amazing term, btw)<p>The Half-Life and Morrowind engines are in a unique situation where they&#x27;re put together by enthusiastic programmers who are paid to develop stuff they think is cool. You end up with minimal engines and great tech, suited to the needs of professional game developers.<p>This seems like something that sits in between a raylib and a Unity. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I worry that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do enough to appeal to amateur programmers, but it does too much to appeal to the kind of programmer who wants a smaller engine. I could be very wrong though, I hope to be very wrong. Seems like the performance here is very nice and it&#x27;s very well put together. There&#x27;s definitely a wave of developers coming out frustrated from Unity right now. As the nostalgia cycle moves to the 2000&#x27;s, there&#x27;s a very real demand to play and create games that are no more graphically complex than Half-Life 2.<p>Anyway, great project.

If I try to speak for a longer time (continuing with the travel example, let&#x27;s say I try to talk about a particular attraction I enjoyed visiting at that location), I&#x27;m usually interrupted, and the focus shifts to whoever interrupted me.<p>This has happened (and still happens often) a lot, in different social circles, with people of diverse backgrounds. So, I figure it&#x27;s not that I hang out with rude people, the problem must be me. I think the saddest part of all this is that even my wife&#x27;s attention drifts off most of the time I try to talk to her.<p>I know it&#x27;s not a language barrier issue, and I know for sure I enunciate my words well. I wonder though if the issue may be that I have a weak voice, or just an overall weak presence&#x2F;body language. How can that be improved, if that&#x27;s the case?",

I also look very young (I am late 30s and\nI still get IDed when buying alcohol).<p>Some things that helped me:<p>- I grew a beared that accentuated my jawline<p>- When people would begin to interrupt me, I would continue on with my sentence regardless of them speaking, and I would finish my sentence. I would be prepared to let it get a little awkward if they don’t get the hint at first<p>- Talking a lot more helped. Since having a baby, I talk to her all the time. I sing and talk loudly and energetically to her to make her laugh. I make up a wide array of characters with voices. This has changed the tone of my voice in that it is now deeper, less strained, and more powerful. I have noticed a difference in my confidence talking to people and how they listen to me.<p>- I noticed a difference in my interactions just after doing Yoga or meditation. Conversation is often about energy, and yoga or meditation can get you more attuned to giving the right amount.<p>- I noticed the less I cared the easier it got. I make sure that I am respectful and acknowledging of people, I am open and receptive to connecting with the right people, but it’s not my mission to be entertaining or interesting to others.<p>- If I feel like I am giving a lot more to the other person&#x2F;people in the interactions, I start to look elsewhere for people that are more reciprocal with their interactions.<p>- I tried reading books on charisma, small talk, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc. I don’t think any of this actually had much impact or it didn’t resonate with me. IMO, going to the gym is probably going to have a lot more impact to get people to listen to you than what books can offer.",

People love to talk about themselves. Ask them honest, thoughtful questions about what they&#x27;re talking about. Don&#x27;t over indulge them, but everyone is equal in this world, and hearing them out on things leads to a healthy discourse.<p>One final tip and this is important, if they talk about a trip to the Bahamas or whatever and you then feel the urge to bring up your similar trip to the Bahamas, maybe don&#x27;t. Instead of hearing their point of view, you&#x27;re making the conversation about you immediately and people don&#x27;t like that.

I walk out, things just continue.<p>What helped me a lot were 2 things:<p>1) There are ways to improve your conversation skills. Big topic, with lots of branches. Your speech matters. Your tone. Keep collecting interesting anecdotes. Culture some depth to your personality that is unrelated to work (e.g. interesting hobbies). Essentially train your charisma.<p>2) The big eye opener for me was the discovery that different groups of people actually react differently to me. I.e.

The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked.

Here are a few things that worked well for me in the past:<p>Learning Key Information: Start by documenting key processes, tech stacks, and team dynamics. One way I did this was by using a knowledge management system (even a simple Google Doc or Notion can work wonders). This helps to ensure you&#x27;re not just absorbing information but also actively organizing it for future reference.<p>Causing a Good Impression: Approach the first few days with humility—understand that every team has its own rhythm and established dynamics. Don&#x27;t rush to make big changes; instead, focus on learning and understanding.<p>Positioning Yourself for Impact: Focus on building trust. Ask smart questions, help where you can without overstepping, and showcase your leadership by sharing knowledge or identifying small wins.<p>Balancing Team Adaptation vs. Not Absorbing Bad Patterns: It’s crucial to observe first and understand the team’s way of working, then slowly suggest improvements without coming across as a disruptor. Find opportunities where your experience can naturally enhance existing workflows without causing friction.<p>Leadership with Less Business Context: Leverage your technical expertise, but be transparent about your learning curve in terms of the business context. Lead by example—help others see that you&#x27;re willing to learn the business side while providing guidance on the technical aspects.<p>On another note, for anyone who wants to stand out in a team or on your company profile, consider using custom avatars for your profile pictures. A personalized, minimalistic custom avatar can make your digital presence more memorable. I created Presentra, a service that transforms your photo into a stylized digital avatar, ideal for professional settings (especially when onboarding or establishing your presence).<p>If anyone’s looking for an easy way to get a custom avatar, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presentra.com&#x2F;</a>",

I’ve upscaled 60,000 cards from the entire catalog of Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, &amp; a newer game, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com</a>. I&#x27;ve made it easy to build a decklist, download it, and then print at home. Modern inkjet printers got really good when nobody was looking.

Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

                    "text": "I&#x27;ve spent 15 years building a career in robotics&#x2F;software engineering along the &quot;traditional path&quot;: writing software to solve problems, mastering fundamentals, and architecting complex systems. I stay on top of cutting-edge technologies to stay relevant, but I’ve mostly seen AI&#x2F;LLMs as powerful tools for augmenting specific tasks rather than fundamentally reshaping engineering as a discipline.<p>However, NVIDIA’s recent CES keynote was another data point in a growing list challenging that view. While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences. I lack the resources to test these claims in depth, so I’m turning to HN for firsthand insights—not sales pitches or market hype.<p>If you’re using NVIDIA’s AI tools (like NeMo, Omniverse, COSMOS, etc.) or broadly working with LLMs&#x2F;multi-modal AI in your daily work or business, I’d love to know:<p>- What are you actually achieving with them?<p>- What are their limitations? Where do they fall short?<p>- What&#x27;s the reliability of the results? Demo-worthy Deployment-ready for high-stakes environments?<p>- Are the challenges you encounter just a matter of “more compute&#x2F;money,” or are they fundamental barriers?<p>- Do these tools help you reach production faster compared to traditional methods?<p>- Anything else you think may be interesting.<p>I’m looking for honest, real-world insights from those at the front lines of these technologies.",

                "report": "In the swirling cauldron of technology trends, it's easy to get caught up in the froth and miss the substance. But if you look closely, you'll see patterns that reveal what really matters to software engineers, especially those in startups where innovation isn't just a buzzword—it's the lifeblood. Let's take a closer look at some themes emerging from recent top posts on Hacker News, the digital agora where developers gather to share and scrutinize ideas.\n\n## The Bright Spots: What’s Getting People Excited\n\n1. **Democratizing Data**: Projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048) embody a powerful trend: making information more accessible. Think of it as a modern-day equivalent of the public library, but on a digital scale. By creating a free search engine for US veteran records, this initiative is part of a larger movement to use technology to tear down the walls that keep data locked away.\n\n2. **Tech with a Twist**: Then there's [PDF Doom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754). This isn't just a game; it's a delightful hack that reimagines what a PDF can do. It's like discovering your old bicycle can fly. This playful approach not only entertains but also sparks curiosity about how we can use existing technologies in fresh, unexpected ways.\n\n3. **AI in the Trenches**: Take [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942), which brings AI and automation to web development. It's the software equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, streamlining mundane tasks so developers can focus on what really counts—innovation. This trend reflects a deeper desire to make our tools work smarter, not harder.\n\n## The Shadows: Areas of Concern\n\n1. **Guarding Privacy**: With projects like [Reclaim The Records](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680048), the flip side of transparency is privacy. The debate here is age-old: how do we balance the public good against individual privacy? The fear is that in our rush to open up data, we might expose sensitive information, like Social Security Numbers, to those with less noble intentions.\n\n2. **Fighting Software Bloat**: Enter the critique of \"turbobloat\" in projects such as [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116). It's as if software has become the digital equivalent of a Swiss chalet—beautiful but unnecessarily ornate. Developers yearn for simplicity, for software that does just enough and no more, without sacrificing performance on the altar of features.\n\n3. **AI’s Reliability Gap**: We've long heard promises of AI's transformative power, but as the discussions following Nvidia's CES keynote [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808) remind us, there's often a chasm between hype and reality. AI, for all its potential, is still in its awkward adolescence, prone to errors that require human oversight.\n\n## The Surprises: Where We Didn’t Expect to Find Gold\n\n1. **Gaming Meets Learning**: The ingenious use of PDFs in gaming, demonstrated by [PDF Doom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754), hints at untapped potential in education. Imagine textbooks that are not only read but experienced interactively, turning learning into an adventure rather than a chore.\n\n2. **Boundary-Breaking Tools**: The buzz around [HipScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623593) shows a promising cross-pollination of ideas. This tool, which runs CUDA in browsers, isn't just a boon for web developers; it's a game-changer for performing complex computations like machine learning directly in the browser. It’s like discovering your car can also sail.\n\n3. **Nostalgia as Innovation**: Finally, the enthusiasm for [Tramway SDK](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42624116) reveals a surprising trend: a longing for the simplicity of older technology. It’s not just nostalgia—it’s a recognition that sometimes the old ways, stripped of modern bloat, can be more effective.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nThe sentiment among developers is one of cautious optimism. There's a palpable excitement about the new tools and technologies on the horizon, but it's tempered by a vigilant awareness of the pitfalls—privacy issues, software inefficiency, and the sometimes shaky bridge between AI's promise and its practical application. The community is alive with debate, driven by a desire to build solutions that don’t just innovate but also endure.",
