All I had to do was implement a framebuffer and keyboard inputs.<p>Unlike previous interactive PDF demos, the output for DoomPDF is achieved by creating a text field for each row of pixels in the screen, then setting their contents to various ASCII characters. This gives me a 6 color monochrome display, that can be updated reasonably quickly (80ms per frame).<p>The source code is available at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ading2210&#x2F;doompdf\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ading2210&#x2F;doompdf</a><p>Note that this PDF can only run in Chromium-based browsers that use the PDFium engine.",

This was inspired by a previous Hacker News post about running Tetris in a PDF. The creator utilized Emscripten to compile C to asm.js, which can operate within the PDF's JavaScript runtime, using a fork of the original Doom source to facilitate input and output handling.\n   \n2. **Notable Discussion Points:**\n   - One comment (0 points) humorously suggests that humanity has reached an extreme with this level of innovation, referencing the \"limited JS runtime of the PDF engine.\"\n   - Another comment (0 points) questions whether the WAD file, essential for Doom's gameplay, is available as a PDF attachment.\n\n3. **Overall Reception:**\n   - The post received a score of 14 points, indicating moderate community interest and engagement.\n   - The comments reflect a mix of amusement and curiosity but lack significant debate or consensus due to their low scores and limited depth.\n   - Overall, the reception is mildly positive with a focus on the novelty and technical ingenuity of the project. The comments suggest a humorous appreciation for the lengths gone to execute this idea."

Those who haven&#x27;t figured out the game often lose hours of their time to nitpickers and pedants without anything better to do.<p>This also results in a slow decay since most of the code ends up being written by people who are good at getting code merged, and not people who are good at building the software.",

A common point of agreement is that the speed and quality of PR reviews can vary greatly depending on the organizational structure and individual team dynamics. For instance, one commenter points out that prompt reviews are common within their team but less consistent across different teams, suggesting that clear communication and direct requests can expedite the process. Another commenter highlights a systemic issue where highly productive engineers bypass formal reviews, indicating a lack of trust or inefficiency in the review process. This sentiment is echoed by another commenter who notes that review processes often become perfunctory and are not recognized as valuable work, especially in environments that emphasize Scrum points. The community seems to agree that while efficient PR reviews are crucial, the current systems often fail due to a combination of cultural and structural factors within organizations.

The creator, working in a government agency, developed this tool to manage projects efficiently without the burdens of procurement or security approval processes. The tool consists of one HTML, one JavaScript, and one CSS file, with projects saved in a .yaml file. It can be hosted on SharePoint by renaming the file extension, making it accessible through a URL.\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n1. **Appreciation and Feedback:** A commenter (0 points) appreciates the open-source nature and simplicity of the tool, suggesting improvements like removing the requirement for a task category and adding export options such as PNG or SVG.\n2. **Comparison with Other Tools:** Another commenter (0 points) notes the increasing complexity of browser-based tools and the unsuitability of expensive software like Microsoft Project for MacOS, expressing frustration with SaaS models and subscriptions.\n3. **Technical Insights:** A comment (0 points) highlights the success of similar lightweight apps and suggests using a plain file picker for enhanced security.\n4. **Feature Requests:** Suggestions include referencing existing charts via URL parameters (0 points) and exploring the possibility of using pure HTML, CSS, and JS without external CDNs (0 points).\n\n**Reception:**\n- **Post Score:** The post received 88 points, indicating significant interest and relevance within the community.\n- **Comment Sentiment and Quality:** Comments generally express appreciation and provide constructive feedback, though they haven't gained substantial upvotes, suggesting limited engagement but a positive reception from those who participated.\n- **Level of Debate or Consensus:** There is a consensus that SimpleGantt addresses a niche problem effectively, highlighting the lack of good lightweight Gantt chart tools for regulated environments. Suggestions for improvements are well-received, indicating user interest in potential enhancements."

Most insightful: \"This is awesome but would be way cooler if you showed a tiny 3d model of cyclist actually traveling the path in real time, with a timer and progress bar etc. People would LOVE to share these which is crucial to the growth of your site.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The sentiment in the discussion is generally positive, with users expressing enthusiasm for the 3D visualization features. However, there are several requests for improvements, such as handling GPX files without timing data and adding features like real-time visualization with a moving 3D model. There is also a suggestion to integrate with other platforms like Strava for easier use. Comments about alternative solutions or platforms like Google Maps and \"Maps 3D\" suggest that users are comparing features and looking for the best tools. The discussion indicates a community interest in enhancing and expanding the accessibility and functionality of these visualization tools, as seen in the request for a Docker setup for easier deployment. Despite the enthusiasm, some users express reluctance to pay for similar features on platforms like Strava, highlighting a potential opportunity for free or more affordable alternatives.

Some commenters suggest improvements such as removing jQuery and using more performant languages like Elixir over PHP, showing a divide in preferences for technical implementation. There's curiosity about the security implications of hosting open-source projects, with concerns about code review rigor. Commenters also compare the service's capabilities with established solutions like Datadog and highlight cost and feature considerations. The lack of comment scores indicates an even distribution of engagement, suggesting no single comment strongly resonated with the community. The conversation touches on practical aspects like user interface preferences and the complexity of existing logging solutions, reflecting a mix of technical critique and user experience feedback.

The app prioritizes privacy and is not affiliated with any medical providers or insurance companies. It is nearing completion and is currently available for beta testing.\n\n2. **Notable Discussion Points:**  \n   - **Legal Concerns:** Several comments (0 points) warn about potential legal issues related to handling personal health information (PHI). Commenters suggest consulting a lawyer to ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA, indicating that the app could be a liability without proper legal frameworks.\n   - **Implementation and Idea:** One comment (0 points) appreciates the app's concept, highlighting the challenges in the U.S. healthcare system regarding care coordination. However, there is a consensus that the app requires further development and legal consideration.\n   - **Comparison to Existing Solutions:** Some users (0 points) question the need for the app, citing existing solutions like MyChart, which already allow family member access to health information. They suggest that the app, as it stands, may serve more as a learning project than a viable product.\n   - **Ownership and Data Storage:** Questions were raised about data ownership and storage location (0 points), emphasizing the importance of transparency and security.\n\n3. **Overall Reception:**\n   - The post received a score of 157 points, indicating a significant level of community interest.\n   - Comment sentiment is mixed, with a strong focus on legal and privacy concerns overshadowing discussions about the app's functionality or potential.\n   - The comments reflect a consensus on the need for careful handling of legal issues, with some expressing skepticism about the app's current readiness for public use. There is no significant debate, but a clear call for the developer to address legal and compliance aspects before proceeding."

                      "text": "I am excited to announce the release of TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that delivers state-of-the-art predictions on small datasets in just 2.8 seconds for classification and 4.8 seconds for regression compared to strong baselines tuned for 4 hours. Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>. You can also try it via API: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn-client</a><p>TabPFN v2 is trained on 130 million synthetic tabular prediction datasets to perform in-context learning and output a predictive distribution for the test data points. Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

Your method might dodge that if users generate their own synthetic data using methods they can verify aren’t themselves encumbered. Is that code available under open licensing? If not, would you offer it for a fee for companies or free for researchers?<p>3. What specific, common uses could amateurs try that would display the model’s ability in a business setting?

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

Farthest North is an unforgettable tale and a must-read for any armchair explorer.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;30197&#x2F;30197-h&#x2F;30197-h.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;30197&#x2F;30197-h&#x2F;30197-h.htm</a>",

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

However, the overall engagement, as reflected by the scores, suggests a passive interest rather than active debate, possibly due to the non-controversial nature of the subject matter or the self-promotional nature of some contributions.

                      "text": "Hi HN! I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

                      "text": "Bin is an AI business intelligence analyst that turns data into dashboards. Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>. Please do let us know what you think – we’re open to feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve Bin.",

This is where BI AI should be, AI&#x27;s integrated into Tableau workbooks editing the core XML of the workbooks, offering translation tooling to convert Prep to Alteryx, Tableau to PBI...etc.<p>It&#x27;s also hard sell if your core platform doesn&#x27;t cover SSO, Encryption, DB integrations, Self Deployment, RBAC&#x27;s, PenTest, Corps looks for these things immediately, and BI tools are purely a Corp thing not a Consumer thing.<p>That said its a cool idea and implementation.",

Most upvoted: \"This is super cool -- I wonder if the next step in this would be to suggest specific dashboards to monitor based on the data that a company collects.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"The .new TLD is very restrictive, it is intended to be used for launching a new something, e.g: docs.new creates a new Google Doc. Your domain does not launch a new 'bi' (whatever that is). The .new TLD is managed by Google and they do enforce this requirement.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"AI focused new BI products are a wash, your focus should be a new BI product with maybe an AI integration (Not the other way around), or an AI integration to an existing BI product.\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion features an array of perspectives on a new Business Intelligence (BI) product launch. The most insightful comment highlights the importance of integrating AI into existing BI frameworks rather than creating standalone AI-focused BI products, indicating a preference for enhancing existing tools rather than reinventing the wheel. This aligns with another comment that suggests focusing on practical integrations and infrastructure needs like SSO and encryption, which are crucial for corporate adoption. The sentiment is generally positive, with several commenters congratulating the launch and expressing enthusiasm about the product's potential. However, there is a critical note on the use of the .new TLD, which may lead to compliance issues with Google's policies. Overall, the community shows interest in innovation within the BI space but emphasizes practicality and integration with current systems. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612237)"

Most upvoted: \"The only data I care about on the phone already gets backed up by Google and is then exported regularly via Google Takeout.\"\n2. Most controversial: \"Having switched phones a couple of months ago, there didn’t seem to be a good option. Either you need to have root - which means that most banking apps won’t work anymore -, you need to backup to the cloud which a) not every app supports and b) I don’t want to do for more private data, or you need to use the backup API that however some apps also don’t support. It’s a mess and I don’t understand that Google hasn’t fixed that.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"My device is rooted and I use NeoBackup to backup apps with all their data (including what the app developer marked as 'should not be backed up', often data that they would like you to backup on their own cloud instead).\"\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion reveals varied approaches and opinions on mobile data backup. Some participants rely heavily on Google's ecosystem for convenience, while others express a strong preference for privacy and self-hosted solutions, such as using Syncthing and Nextcloud. Concerns about the limitations of cloud services and the challenges of backing up without root access are prominent. The community shows no clear consensus, as all comments have a score of 0, indicating an even spread of viewpoints without strong agreement or disagreement. The most controversial comment points to the fragmented state of backup solutions, highlighting a desire for more comprehensive and user-friendly options. The insightful comment about using NeoBackup demonstrates an alternative approach that bypasses app-imposed backup restrictions.

If you’ve ever wondered whether your website images have alt text or if you&#x27;re struggling to keep track of all your images for accessibility, we’ve got just the thing.<p>We created an Image Alt Text Checker that quickly scans your website and tells you if any images are missing alt text. It’s super easy to use—just drop your website URL, and the tool does the rest. In seconds, you get a report showing which images need alt text, so you can fix them up in no time.<p>We built this tool with accessibility in mind. It’s not just about SEO (though it definitely helps with that too!); it’s about making your site more user-friendly for people who rely on screen readers. And let’s face it, who doesn’t want a more inclusive website, right?<p>It’s 100% free, and honestly, it saves so much time compared to checking each image manually.

Brain surgeon had a bunch of FDA complaints against them too and performed it in one of the poorest cities in the country, across the street from a burnt out apartment building.

I would be prepared to let it get a little awkward if they don’t get the hint at first<p>- Talking a lot more helped. Since having a baby, I talk to her all the time. I sing and talk loudly and energetically to her to make her laugh. I make up a wide array of characters with voices. This has changed the tone of my voice in that it is now deeper, less strained, and more powerful. I have noticed a difference in my confidence talking to people and how they listen to me.<p>- I noticed a difference in my interactions just after doing Yoga or meditation. Conversation is often about energy, and yoga or meditation can get you more attuned to giving the right amount.<p>- I noticed the less I cared the easier it got. I make sure that I am respectful and acknowledging of people, I am open and receptive to connecting with the right people, but it’s not my mission to be entertaining or interesting to others.<p>- If I feel like I am giving a lot more to the other person&#x2F;people in the interactions, I start to look elsewhere for people that are more reciprocal with their interactions.<p>- I tried reading books on charisma, small talk, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc. I don’t think any of this actually had much impact or it didn’t resonate with me.

People love to talk about themselves. Ask them honest, thoughtful questions about what they&#x27;re talking about. Don&#x27;t over indulge them, but everyone is equal in this world, and hearing them out on things leads to a healthy discourse.<p>One final tip and this is important, if they talk about a trip to the Bahamas or whatever and you then feel the urge to bring up your similar trip to the Bahamas, maybe don&#x27;t. Instead of hearing their point of view, you&#x27;re making the conversation about you immediately and people don&#x27;t like that.

Keep collecting interesting anecdotes. Culture some depth to your personality that is unrelated to work (e.g. interesting hobbies). Essentially train your charisma.<p>2) The big eye opener for me was the discovery that different groups of people actually react differently to me. I.e.

I would be prepared to let it get a little awkward if they don’t get the hint at first<p>- Talking a lot more helped. Since having a baby, I talk to her all the time. I sing and talk loudly and energetically to her to make her laugh. I make up a wide array of characters with voices. This has changed the tone of my voice in that it is now deeper, less strained, and more powerful. I have noticed a difference in my confidence talking to people and how they listen to me.<p>- I noticed a difference in my interactions just after doing Yoga or meditation. Conversation is often about energy, and yoga or meditation can get you more attuned to giving the right amount.<p>- I noticed the less I cared the easier it got. I make sure that I am respectful and acknowledging of people, I am open and receptive to connecting with the right people, but it’s not my mission to be entertaining or interesting to others.<p>- If I feel like I am giving a lot more to the other person&#x2F;people in the interactions, I start to look elsewhere for people that are more reciprocal with their interactions.<p>- I tried reading books on charisma, small talk, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc. I don’t think any of this actually had much impact or it didn’t resonate with me.

Don&#x27;t over indulge them, but everyone is equal in this world, and hearing them out on things leads to a healthy discourse.<p>One final tip and this is important, if they talk about a trip to the Bahamas or whatever and you then feel the urge to bring up your similar trip to the Bahamas, maybe don&#x27;t. Instead of hearing their point of view, you&#x27;re making the conversation about you immediately and people don&#x27;t like that.

Keep collecting interesting anecdotes. Culture some depth to your personality that is unrelated to work (e.g. interesting hobbies).

There is a consensus that modulating voice tone and engaging in genuine curiosity about others' experiences can enhance conversations. The community also agrees on the importance of not dominating conversations with personal anecdotes but rather encouraging others to share more, as reflected in several comments emphasizing the importance of listening and asking questions. Some disagreements arise around how best to balance self-expression with listening, as seen in comments suggesting self-analysis and potential overemphasis on personal interests.

In most tech, the things that catch on are the things that \nare the easiest to develop curriculum for. The shape of a node-based editor like Unity is uniquely suited to explaining over a number of classes. (Source: I had to learn Unity at my University) On the other hand, an engine like raylib can be grokked in an afternoon, so a university-level raylib class wouldn&#x27;t work. So you have all these amateur game developers and programmers coming out of diploma mills, and all they know is Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so companies hire Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so universities teach it, etc. See also: Java being popular. Then of course, all these companies have wildly different needs for their Unity projects, so Unity, being a for-profit company that serves its customers and not a single disgruntled programmer, has to conform their engine. So you end up with &#x27;turbobloat.&#x27; (amazing term, btw)<p>The Half-Life and Morrowind engines are in a unique situation where they&#x27;re put together by enthusiastic programmers who are paid to develop stuff they think is cool. You end up with minimal engines and great tech, suited to the needs of professional game developers.<p>This seems like something that sits in between a raylib and a Unity. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I worry that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do enough to appeal to amateur programmers, but it does too much to appeal to the kind of programmer who wants a smaller engine. I could be very wrong though, I hope to be very wrong. Seems like the performance here is very nice and it&#x27;s very well put together. There&#x27;s definitely a wave of developers coming out frustrated from Unity right now. As the nostalgia cycle moves to the 2000&#x27;s, there&#x27;s a very real demand to play and create games that are no more graphically complex than Half-Life 2.<p>Anyway, great project.

In most tech, the things that catch on are the things that \nare the easiest to develop curriculum for. The shape of a node-based editor like Unity is uniquely suited to explaining over a number of classes. (Source: I had to learn Unity at my University) On the other hand, an engine like raylib can be grokked in an afternoon, so a university-level raylib class wouldn&#x27;t work. So you have all these amateur game developers and programmers coming out of diploma mills, and all they know is Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so companies hire Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so universities teach it, etc. See also: Java being popular. Then of course, all these companies have wildly different needs for their Unity projects, so Unity, being a for-profit company that serves its customers and not a single disgruntled programmer, has to conform their engine. So you end up with &#x27;turbobloat.&#x27; (amazing term, btw)<p>The Half-Life and Morrowind engines are in a unique situation where they&#x27;re put together by enthusiastic programmers who are paid to develop stuff they think is cool. You end up with minimal engines and great tech, suited to the needs of professional game developers.<p>This seems like something that sits in between a raylib and a Unity. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I worry that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do enough to appeal to amateur programmers, but it does too much to appeal to the kind of programmer who wants a smaller engine. I could be very wrong though, I hope to be very wrong. Seems like the performance here is very nice and it&#x27;s very well put together. There&#x27;s definitely a wave of developers coming out frustrated from Unity right now. As the nostalgia cycle moves to the 2000&#x27;s, there&#x27;s a very real demand to play and create games that are no more graphically complex than Half-Life 2.<p>Anyway, great project.

While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences. I lack the resources to test these claims in depth, so I’m turning to HN for firsthand insights—not sales pitches or market hype.<p>If you’re using NVIDIA’s AI tools (like NeMo, Omniverse, COSMOS, etc.) or broadly working with LLMs&#x2F;multi-modal AI in your daily work or business, I’d love to know:<p>- What are you actually achieving with them?<p>- What are their limitations? Where do they fall short?<p>- What&#x27;s the reliability of the results?

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.

Disrespect current processes.  What you call “legacy code” was done for a reason, is generating revenue, solving real world problems, and the reason you have a job<p>2. Make <i>any</i> suggestions about improving processes before you have been their at least 90 days and understand why the current system is like it is.<p>3. Suggest rewriting something or introducing new to the company technology until you have worked there 90 days.  Especially don’t start doing resume driven development.<p>What to do:<p>1. Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.  The org chart will not show you who has the most influence in your department.<p>4. Setup “getting to know you” 1-1’s.  What are people working on? What do they want to be working on? What are their biggest pain points? What would they improve if they had a magic wand?<p>5. Pick up small stories, bugs to get familiar with the development process.<p>6.  Learn about pre-wiring a meeting when you are trying to suggest changes.  Do a POC, talk to the person who might have the biggest objection or has the most influence and work collaboratively to address their objectives.  Keep doing that for more people on your team.  It helps get more people on your side.<p>ADKAR change management model<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prosci.com&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;adkar</a>",

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked. Not to mention that type of proactivity in and of itself impressed a lot of people; doing things for clout is dumb but making things you learn public and synthesizing them into a form that&#x27;s accessible to others is an important hallmark of a senior in my opinion.<p>Ask SO many questions. Got opaque docs that are important? Ask for a quick meeting with the person who wrote them to make sure your understanding is crystal clear.

It’s totally free, give it a try!<p>Supplies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies</a>\nPrinter Settings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings</a>\nInstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions</a><p>Overview: I built Cardstock because I had some scripts to do this lying around, and wanted to explore the new Rails 8 magic. Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

Positive comments highlight the potential and utility of the product, as seen in the first and second comments praising the idea and asking for examples of printed cards. However, criticisms focus on usability issues, such as the need for an account to access the homepage, which one commenter found off-putting, suggesting that more transparency might improve user engagement. Additionally, there is a cautionary note about potential legal issues from Wizards of the Coast, indicating a concern about the project's sustainability. The community seems to value both the technical innovation and the user experience, but there is a clear call for improvement in presentation and accessibility.

Most upvoted: \"perhaps try to find what you can pull from the responsibilities of other project managers to demonstrate your positive impact on the project for the next performance review\"\n2. Most controversial: \"Love that &quot;senior&quot; PMs need to have exactly zero years experience as PM to be a senior PM.\"\n3. Most insightful: \"As a junior PM should have a mentor from within the company.

One comment suggests leveraging the responsibilities of other project managers to highlight personal contributions during performance reviews. Another highlights the importance of mentorship, suggesting that finding a mentor within the company could be a crucial first step for career development. The final comment humorously critiques the qualifications of senior PMs, indicating a potential issue with experience requirements in the field. Despite the lack of comment scores, these insights provide valuable advice and critique that can guide junior PMs in their professional growth. The absence of upvotes suggests these contributions were equally valued by the community. [Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42657982)"

My father bought me Sinclair ZX Spectrum+ when I was in the first grade. Since then, computers were part of my life, significantly. I stare at my screen almost whole day. One day there was some voice in me saying &quot;Buy a typewriter&quot;. I listened to the voice and bought Smith Corona Silent from 1946. It was the most profound experience I ever had with some kind of machine. I was not so happy when I got my first cell phone, and later smartphone nor computer. This is something different, probably because the basics are the same, I&#x27;m still typing.<p>Suddenly I found myself writing a diary, and a novel. I never wrote anything other than blog posts (many of them since I had website similar to The Verge) - which I sold later.<p>I now have 3 typewriters, 2x Smith Corona Silent (1946 and 1956), and Olympia Monica (I think it&#x27;s from &#x27;70).<p>What I found very interesting is that writing on a typewriter is perfectly synchronized with how fast my mind is working. Time slows down! I read that on the web somewhere, and it is slowing the time when you type on a typewriter! I can confess that!<p>My fingers are too fast on computer keyboard, and I even don&#x27;t want to talk about distractions like auto correct and other stuff that always pops up. This is something what really makes me feel good. I can write a story, poem, diary, or a letter to a friend.<p>It&#x27;s truly something we should have on our desk somewhere in the room, and just put our thoughts on a paper.",

Several commenters express frustration with the terminology and complexity of Flexbox properties, such as \"justify-content\" and \"align-items,\" which are seen as unintuitive. Others suggest resources like Flexbox Froggy and CSS Grid Garden, highlighting the importance of practice and visualization tools like developer tools in browsers. Despite the challenges, there is a consensus that Flexbox is powerful once understood, with some finding it straightforward and others continuing to struggle. The mention of ChatGPT and cheat sheets indicates a reliance on external aids to grasp Flexbox concepts. Overall, the community appears divided in their ease of use and learning strategies for Flexbox, with no dominant consensus due to the equal scoring of comments.

                      "text": "Hi,<p>As an enthusiast chess player, I like to manage my games and my opening repertoire as a set of PGN files stored in a Git repository (PGN is a text file format for recording chess games). So I wanted a way to pretty-print PGN files using a CLI and integrating in my editor.<p>Today, it looks like most people use GUI-based software. So I decided to create a Prettier plugin that formats PGN files. Prettier is a well-known pretty-printer in the Node.js ecosystem, used to ensure consistent source code formatting in software projects. One upside of implementing this PGN formatter as a Prettier plugin is that it benefits from its editor integration.<p>The plugin is currently near complete, even if the project is still at an early stage. It&#x27;s usable, even if there might be some bugs.<p>Hope you find this useful. Comments and ideas are welcome. Have a nice weekend.",

                      "text": "Like many of you, I have spent more time trying out different applications in the todo list&#x2F;knowledge management space without finding a solution that has stuck. I&#x27;ve tried aggressive calendar scheduling, todo.txt, Vikunja, a paper planner, Logseq, Notion, and likely others along the way! I now have the suspicion that the issue I&#x27;m having isn&#x27;t the tooling, but the process. The solution I&#x27;ve stuck with the longest has been Vikunja, but I felt limited by it as it is strictly a todo application, and doesn&#x27;t support any form of knowledge management (by design, which makes sense!)<p>So I&#x27;m wondering, what processes do people follow for their todo list management and knowledge management? What resources have you learned how to use your applications of choice?<p>My requirements (in rough priority order):<p>- Mobile + Desktop support (PWA, web UI, native application, all fine!)<p>- Searchable<p>- Allows me to keep track of todos with priority ordering and sublists<p>- Allows me to easily capture one-off ideas, as well as expand them into richer, more detailed concepts<p>- FOSS + Self-Hostable<p>The issues I&#x27;ve faced with previous solutions are:<p>- No integration between my todos and knowledge!<p>- Not being able to search<p>- Not being able to quickly capture ideas&#x2F;notes&#x2F;todos<p>- Not having a clean(-ish) UX to navigate between points of info&#x2F;see what my next priorities are",

Most upvoted: What kind of integration between your todos and knowledge? If you haven&#x27;t found one, how about building your own todo app that fits your needs. I have a demo here [link]\n2. Most controversial: Zim - Wysiwyg for markdown files [link] My only complaints are that it uses .txt instead of .md and that I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work on Mac.\n3. Most insightful: I use emacs org mode (and emacs org node and emacs org agenda), and Orgzly Revived on Android (the latter can do DAV sync). It&#x27;s quite nice and can do integration, search and quick capture, TODOs. It&#x27;s also endlessly customizable--but I almost don&#x27;t customize it.\n\nANALYSIS: The discussion is centered around personal recommendations for productivity and note-taking apps, with no single app emerging as a clear favorite. Each comment suggests a different app, from Emacs Org Mode to Trello, highlighting the diversity in user preferences and needs. The absence of any upvotes or downvotes suggests a lack of engagement or strong opinions, indicating that the community might see this as a subjective topic where individual needs outweigh a collective preference. The comments reflect a variety of solutions, some emphasizing open-source options while others prioritize functionality and user experience.

In recent times, it’s been a vivid reflection of the trends shaping our tech world, so let’s dive into what’s hot and what’s not.\n\n## Positive Vibes from the Tech Oasis\n\n1. **Nostalgic Gaming in New Guises**:\n   It’s fascinating how the old becomes new again. Projects like [Doom running inside a PDF](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754) and [3D Terrain simulations for hiking and skiing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660255) are not just about tech wizardry; they’re a testament to the enduring appeal of classic games. It’s like finding a vintage car fitted with a Tesla engine—familiar, yet thrillingly modern.\n\n2. **The Open Source Renaissance**:\n   Tools like [SimpleGantt](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647668) and [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942) remind us of the power of open source. These tools don’t just lower the barrier to entry; they practically obliterate it. They’re like public libraries for code—accessible, resourceful, and community-driven, proving that great tools don’t need a hefty price tag.\n\n3. **Learning Through Visualization**:\n   Platforms such as [Atlas of Space](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634787) and [Flexbox Playground](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600586) are turning complex ideas into something tangible. It’s like turning calculus into a painting. By making the abstract concrete, these tools are redefining how we learn, one interactive visualization at a time.\n\n## Shadows in the Tech Landscape\n\n1. **Security, The Eternal Nemesis**:\n   Whenever we push the envelope, security tends to push back. Projects like [Tetris in a PDF](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645218) spark debates about vulnerabilities lurking in these innovative formats. It’s the classic tension between freedom and control—how much risk are we willing to accept for the sake of progress?\n\n2. **The Fragmentation Frustration**:\n   Discussions like [What is a common PR review time at your company?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656621) reveal the gnarly underbelly of software development: disjointed tools and processes. It’s like trying to run a marathon in mismatched shoes. The inefficiencies eat away at productivity, begging for a more unified approach.\n\n3. **AI: The Oversold Dream?**:\n   There’s a distinct wariness around AI, especially with the hype surrounding it in events like [Nvidia's CES keynote](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808). AI promises the moon, but users often find themselves holding a handful of dust. The gap between marketing glitz and actual utility is a chasm that’s yet to be bridged.\n\n## The Unexpected Twists\n\n1. **Retro Tech Resurgence**:\n   Who would’ve thought typewriters would make a comeback? Posts like [I'm a Programmer Who Bought a Typewriter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660042) highlight a craving for simplicity. In an age of distractions, sometimes less is more—a reminder that progress isn’t always about more features.\n\n2. **Community as the New Innovator**:\n   The revival of [Mashups.io](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42609819) mirrors the resilience of community-driven innovation. It’s like a phoenix rising from the ashes of Yahoo Pipes. When companies abandon platforms, the community steps in, driven by a genuine need for user-centric solutions.\n\n3. **The Fusion of Disciplines**:\n   Projects like [HipScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623593) show us the magic that happens when disciplines intersect. Running CUDA in browsers? That’s like discovering a Swiss Army knife where you least expect it. This cross-pollination opens doors to new possibilities we hadn’t dared imagine.\n\n## The Balancing Act\n\nThe tech world is a dance of optimism and skepticism. With every innovation comes the question of its real-world impact—will it live up to the hype? Yet, amidst the challenges, there’s a clear sense of excitement. The community continues to navigate this delicate balance, ever hopeful, yet grounded in the realities of implementation, security, and usability.",

I used the doomgeneric (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ozkl&#x2F;doomgeneric\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ozkl&#x2F;doomgeneric</a>) fork of the original Doom source, as that made writing the IO fairly easy. All I had to do was implement a framebuffer and keyboard inputs.<p>Unlike previous interactive PDF demos, the output for DoomPDF is achieved by creating a text field for each row of pixels in the screen, then setting their contents to various ASCII characters. This gives me a 6 color monochrome display, that can be updated reasonably quickly (80ms per frame).<p>The source code is available at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ading2210&#x2F;doompdf\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ading2210&#x2F;doompdf</a><p>Note that this PDF can only run in Chromium-based browsers that use the PDFium engine.",

Published in Nature, this model outperforms traditional methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features.<p>The model is available under an open license: a derivative of the Apache 2 license with a single modification, adding an enhanced attribution requirement inspired by the Llama 3 license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PriorLabs&#x2F;tabpfn</a>.

Each dataset acts as one meta-datapoint to train the TabPFN weights with SGD. As a foundation model, TabPFN allows for fine-tuning, density estimation and data generation.<p>Compared to TabPFN v1, v2 now natively supports categorical features and missing values. TabPFN v2 performs just as well on datasets with or without these. It also handles outliers and uninformative features naturally, problems that often throw off standard neural nets.<p>TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline (CatBoost) with all the data.<p>We also compared TabPFN to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 1.0. Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression, but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 (PHE) is even better.<p>There are some limitations: TabPFN v2 is very fast to train and does not require hyperparameter tuning, but inference is slow. The model is also only designed for datasets up to 10k data points and 500 features. While it may perform well on larger datasets, it hasn&#x27;t been our focus.<p>We&#x27;re actively working on removing these limitations and intend to release new versions of TabPFN that can handle larger datasets, have faster inference and perform in additional predictive settings such as time-series and recommender systems.<p>We would love for you to try out TabPFN v2 and give us your feedback!",

The Y Combinator people call it doing things that don’t scale. Here is how it works for absolutely anything:<p>1. Get the right tools in place. This is an intrinsic capability set you have to build. People tend to fail here most frequently and hope some framework or copy&#x2F;paste of a library will just do it for them. Don’t be some worthless pretender. Know your shit from experience so you can execute with confidence.<p>2. Build a solid foundation. This will require a lot of trial and error plus several rounds of refactoring because you need some idea of the edge cases and where you the pain points are. You will know it when you have it because it’s highly durable and requires less of everything compared to the alternatives. A solid foundation isn’t a thing you sell. It’s your baseline for doing everything else at low cost.<p>3. Create tests. These should be in writing but they don’t have to be. You need a list of known successes and failures ready to apply at everything new. There are a lot of whiners that are quick to cry about how something can’t be done. Fuck those guys and instead try it to know exactly what more it takes to get done.<p>4. Finally, measure things. It is absolutely astonishing that most people cannot do this at all. It looks amazing when you see it done well and this is ultimately what separates the adults from the children. This is where velocity comes from because you will know exactly how much faster you are compared to where you were. If you aren’t intimately aware of your performance in numbers from a variety of perspectives you aren’t more special than anyone else.<p>People who accomplish hard things are capable of doing those because they didn’t get stuck. They had the proper tools in place to manipulate their environment, redefine execution (foundation), objectively determine what works without guessing, and then know how much to tweak it moving forward.",

I’m Anirudh — longtime lurker, first time poster, and I couldn’t be more excited to show you Stagehand.<p>Stagehand is a TypeScript project that extends Playwright with three simple AI methods — act, extract, and observe. We’d love for you to try it out using the command below:<p><pre><code>    npx create-browser-app --example quickstart\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a sample workflow:<p><pre><code>    const stagehand = new Stagehand();\n    await stagehand.init();\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Stagehand overrides the Playwright Page and Context classes\n    const { page, context } = stagehand\n\n    await page.goto(&quot;instadash.com&quot;) &#x2F;&#x2F; Regular Playwright\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Take action on the page\n    await page.act({ action: &quot;click on taqueria cazadores&quot; })\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Extract relevant data from the page\n    const { price } = await page.extract({\n        instruction: &quot;extract the price of the super burrito&quot;,\n        schema: z.object({\n            price: z.number()\n        })\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nWe built Stagehand because we loved building browser automations using Playwright and Selenium, but we grew frustrated at how cumbersome it is to just get started and write simple browser automations. These frameworks, while incredibly powerful, are built for QA testing and are thus notoriously prone to fail if there are minor changes in the UI or underlying DOM structure.<p>The goal of Stagehand is twofold:<p>1. Make browser automations easier to write\n2. Make browser automations more resilient to DOM changes.<p>We were super energized by what we’ve been seeing with vision-based computer use agents. We think with a browser, you can provide even richer data by leveraging the information in the DOM + a11y tree in addition to what’s rendered on the page. However, we didn’t want to go so far as to build an agent, since we wanted fine-grained control over each step that an agent can take.<p>Therefore, the happy medium we built was to extend the existing powerful functionalities of Playwright with simple and extensible AI APIs that return the decision-making power back to the developer at each step.<p>Check out our docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stagehand.dev</a><p>We’d love for you to join and give us feedback on Slack as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stagehand.dev&#x2F;slack</a>",

Our goal is to make creating dashboards simpler to do than no-code alternatives like PowerBI and Tableau while preserving the powerful customization abilities of raw SQL and Python.<p>Here’s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fsh8M3hIjDA</a>.<p>Customers from our previous product wanted custom dashboards but didn’t want to spend on technical staff to build them. They wanted customizability of the dashboard yet simplicity of the building experience.<p>So, we studied the approaches of Devin, Claude Artifacts, and v0 and wanted a version that was purpose built for making dashboards and admin pages to solve this problem. This way anyone could spin up highly custom dashboards fast without knowing PowerBI, Tableau, Python, or SQL.<p>The interface is similar to Cursor, where you attach database context and then prompt Bin on a side chat to make visual components (charts, cards, graphs). You can then click to add these components onto your panel.<p>On the backend, Bin spins up the components in React code and data queries in Python + SQL code in one go. We’ve wired up Bin with tool calls so that it can make the query given the schema and table context of your selected database, execute the query, and then make the component with the query key passed into our useQuery function. We make all of this code for the component and query viewable and editable on the platform.<p>Once components are added, you can then drag and drop, resize, and reorganize them on the panel layout. The dashboard will self-update over time as more data enters your database (the queries are re-executed with every refresh). After finalizing, you can deploy the dashboard or embed it onto your other internal tools.<p>You can try Bin today on a test database for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bi.new</a>.

I would be prepared to let it get a little awkward if they don’t get the hint at first<p>- Talking a lot more helped. Since having a baby, I talk to her all the time. I sing and talk loudly and energetically to her to make her laugh. I make up a wide array of characters with voices. This has changed the tone of my voice in that it is now deeper, less strained, and more powerful. I have noticed a difference in my confidence talking to people and how they listen to me.<p>- I noticed a difference in my interactions just after doing Yoga or meditation. Conversation is often about energy, and yoga or meditation can get you more attuned to giving the right amount.<p>- I noticed the less I cared the easier it got. I make sure that I am respectful and acknowledging of people, I am open and receptive to connecting with the right people, but it’s not my mission to be entertaining or interesting to others.<p>- If I feel like I am giving a lot more to the other person&#x2F;people in the interactions, I start to look elsewhere for people that are more reciprocal with their interactions.<p>- I tried reading books on charisma, small talk, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc. I don’t think any of this actually had much impact or it didn’t resonate with me.

Don&#x27;t over indulge them, but everyone is equal in this world, and hearing them out on things leads to a healthy discourse.<p>One final tip and this is important, if they talk about a trip to the Bahamas or whatever and you then feel the urge to bring up your similar trip to the Bahamas, maybe don&#x27;t. Instead of hearing their point of view, you&#x27;re making the conversation about you immediately and people don&#x27;t like that.

Keep collecting interesting anecdotes. Culture some depth to your personality that is unrelated to work (e.g. interesting hobbies). Essentially train your charisma.<p>2) The big eye opener for me was the discovery that different groups of people actually react differently to me. I.e.

In most tech, the things that catch on are the things that \nare the easiest to develop curriculum for. The shape of a node-based editor like Unity is uniquely suited to explaining over a number of classes. (Source: I had to learn Unity at my University) On the other hand, an engine like raylib can be grokked in an afternoon, so a university-level raylib class wouldn&#x27;t work. So you have all these amateur game developers and programmers coming out of diploma mills, and all they know is Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so companies hire Unity&#x2F;Unreal, so universities teach it, etc. See also: Java being popular. Then of course, all these companies have wildly different needs for their Unity projects, so Unity, being a for-profit company that serves its customers and not a single disgruntled programmer, has to conform their engine. So you end up with &#x27;turbobloat.&#x27; (amazing term, btw)<p>The Half-Life and Morrowind engines are in a unique situation where they&#x27;re put together by enthusiastic programmers who are paid to develop stuff they think is cool. You end up with minimal engines and great tech, suited to the needs of professional game developers.<p>This seems like something that sits in between a raylib and a Unity. I haven&#x27;t used it, but I worry that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do enough to appeal to amateur programmers, but it does too much to appeal to the kind of programmer who wants a smaller engine. I could be very wrong though, I hope to be very wrong. Seems like the performance here is very nice and it&#x27;s very well put together. There&#x27;s definitely a wave of developers coming out frustrated from Unity right now.

                    "text": "I&#x27;ve spent 15 years building a career in robotics&#x2F;software engineering along the &quot;traditional path&quot;: writing software to solve problems, mastering fundamentals, and architecting complex systems. I stay on top of cutting-edge technologies to stay relevant, but I’ve mostly seen AI&#x2F;LLMs as powerful tools for augmenting specific tasks rather than fundamentally reshaping engineering as a discipline.<p>However, NVIDIA’s recent CES keynote was another data point in a growing list challenging that view. While yes, primarily a sales pitch, the vision they presented suggests:<p>- AI can solve any problem across modalities—just feed it data.<p>- The future of engineering focuses on data gathering and AI integration, moving away from first-principles problem-solving.<p>While the presentation was compelling, my <i>consumer experience</i> with AI&#x2F;LLMs has been vastly different:<p>- Great for suggestive tasks but unreliable for authoritative answers.<p>- Good for prototyping and scaffolding, but major rewrites are often needed for production-ready code.<p>- Image generation impresses but often includes noticeable flaws.<p>- Hallucinations across all modalities remain a major issue.<p>So, there’s this gap between the vision of AI&#x2F;LLMs as a revolutionary paradigm and my practical experiences. I lack the resources to test these claims in depth, so I’m turning to HN for firsthand insights—not sales pitches or market hype.<p>If you’re using NVIDIA’s AI tools (like NeMo, Omniverse, COSMOS, etc.) or broadly working with LLMs&#x2F;multi-modal AI in your daily work or business, I’d love to know:<p>- What are you actually achieving with them?<p>- What are their limitations? Where do they fall short?<p>- What&#x27;s the reliability of the results? Demo-worthy Deployment-ready for high-stakes environments?<p>- Are the challenges you encounter just a matter of “more compute&#x2F;money,” or are they fundamental barriers?<p>- Do these tools help you reach production faster compared to traditional methods?<p>- Anything else you think may be interesting.<p>I’m looking for honest, real-world insights from those at the front lines of these technologies.",

Even though its got problems DLSS3 has been quite popular for gamers and below perfect in these example are fine the errors aren&#x27;t very consequential.<p>I don&#x27;t know where this goes. I do know each generation of AI has improved quite a lot and we no longer talk about the turing test, we definitely took a jump but there remains a lot of hard engineering problems in every domain of AI to make it function as we want it to.

Set up a meeting with sales and ask them to “sale you the value proposition of the product as if you are the customer”.  Ask questions as if you were a potential customs and raise objections to the product as  if you were customer.  Sales is usually very good at answering those questions.<p>2. Talk to your manager and ask what are their 90 day and 1 year plans for your team and make sure your work is aligned with the goals.<p>3. Get to know the pecking order.

I ended up doing ten interviews in my first two weeks, published a little internal blog post about common themes and what I learned, and that helped shape a lot about how I worked. Not to mention that type of proactivity in and of itself impressed a lot of people; doing things for clout is dumb but making things you learn public and synthesizing them into a form that&#x27;s accessible to others is an important hallmark of a senior in my opinion.<p>Ask SO many questions.

                    "text": "Trading cards are awesome, but paying $30 for some cardboard isn’t. I’ve upscaled 60,000 cards from the entire catalog of Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, &amp; a newer game, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elestrals.com</a>. I&#x27;ve made it easy to build a decklist, download it, and then print at home. Modern inkjet printers got really good when nobody was looking. While it’s clear they’re not real cards, the upscaling makes them look great for casual play (these are not tournament legal). It’s totally free, give it a try!<p>Supplies: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;supplies</a>\nPrinter Settings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;settings</a>\nInstructions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardstock.denta.co&#x2F;kb&#x2F;instructions</a><p>Overview: I built Cardstock because I had some scripts to do this lying around, and wanted to explore the new Rails 8 magic. Kamal 2 (kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;) is a game changer, SQLite in production is fine, and the database backed solid family of gems work like a charm.<p>Compute: I am renting a box on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hetzner.com</a> located in VA for $15&#x2F;mo. This box has 8 gigs of ram and 2 vCPU&#x27;s. This is such a deal compared to compute prices on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;render.com</a>.<p>Kamal 2: This thing is amazing. Kamal gives me everything I could want (easy console access, easy shell access, a way to manage secrets, a way to see my logs, and letsencrypt support for DNS), all without a PaaS tax. The best part is the accessories feature: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kamal-deploy.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;commands&#x2F;accessory&#x2F;</a>. I am running my main app with two accessories: Meilisearch(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meilisearch.com</a>) and OpenObserve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openobserve.ai</a>). Instead of paying Algolia to host search infrastructure and sentry to host monitoring infrastructure, I’m hosting my own OSS without any fanfare.<p>Upscaling: To upscale the trading cards (a mandatory part of this build, scans are never high enough DPI). I am using this (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicate.com&#x2F;nightmareai&#x2F;real-esrgan</a>) model. For upscaling every card, I&#x27;ve used under a hundred bucks of compute. This model was picked on a whim, but worked well enough that I didn’t compare other models.<p>SQLite: I used SQLite combined with Litestream (litestream.io) for my database. While I considered Postgres, I hesitated due to uncertainties around handling backups on self-hosted infrastructure. This was my first time using SQLite in production, and it was functional but with some minor annoyances. Here’s what I encountered: 1. No Default UUID Primary Key Type I had to set primary keys as strings and assign IDs manually from the application record. It’s an annoying workaround but manageable. 2. No Native Array Columns Because SQLite doesn’t support array columns, I had to use its native JSON column type, which just felt icky. If I were working with something like embeddings, this would be especially annoying, because you couldn’t enforce all the records to have the same number of dimensions. 3. Cryptic Errors At one point, a migration failed silently, leaving a cryptic error in schema.rb. The issue was resolved by rolling back the migration and redoing it, but it was once again, annoying. 4. Litestream Defaults Litestream deletes snapshots after 24 hours by default, which is far too short. When I tried to recover some data, I found it had already been deleted. Adjusting these defaults fixed the problem.<p>Solid Queue&#x2F;Cache&#x2F;Cable: The solid family of gems are all backed by the database and were a pleasure to work with. Goal was to prevent needing to reach for redis, so you have one less thing to worry about. You end up with a little more latency, which is a totally reasonable tradeoff.<p>Conclusions: We are moving into a post platform as a service world. Instead of buying a bespoke render.com or heroku, you just buy commodity compute and use Kamal to manage. It&#x27;s like, pretty much all there, excited to see how this space matures.",

I listened to the voice and bought Smith Corona Silent from 1946. It was the most profound experience I ever had with some kind of machine. I was not so happy when I got my first cell phone, and later smartphone nor computer. This is something different, probably because the basics are the same, I&#x27;m still typing.<p>Suddenly I found myself writing a diary, and a novel. I never wrote anything other than blog posts (many of them since I had website similar to The Verge) - which I sold later.<p>I now have 3 typewriters, 2x Smith Corona Silent (1946 and 1956), and Olympia Monica (I think it&#x27;s from &#x27;70).<p>What I found very interesting is that writing on a typewriter is perfectly synchronized with how fast my mind is working.

Then an Olympia Deluxe with Script font given to my beloved.<p>If you are looking for a typewriter:<p>+ maybe think about the case. Does it stack well? Can you stack stuff on top of it? Because at some point you will probably want to free up the space where your typewriter sits or transport it or store it.<p>+ check the typeface. The Olympia with script typeface was a bargain, but it is script. The 6CPI SCM was a surprise. Can you live with the typeface?<p>+ are you handy? Typewriter service is basic millwrighting. You will want decent flathead screwdrivers and some time on Youtube.<p>[1] If I come across another SCM with 6CPI for the right price I will have two typewriters. 6CPI changes the way I write and matches well with images...I got the Hermes Baby because I wanted a small font. It was too small and the way the text looked on the page turned me off. The Olympia is good enough, which is good enough.",

So I decided to create a Prettier plugin that formats PGN files. Prettier is a well-known pretty-printer in the Node.js ecosystem, used to ensure consistent source code formatting in software projects. One upside of implementing this PGN formatter as a Prettier plugin is that it benefits from its editor integration.<p>The plugin is currently near complete, even if the project is still at an early stage.

I&#x27;ve tried aggressive calendar scheduling, todo.txt, Vikunja, a paper planner, Logseq, Notion, and likely others along the way! I now have the suspicion that the issue I&#x27;m having isn&#x27;t the tooling, but the process. The solution I&#x27;ve stuck with the longest has been Vikunja, but I felt limited by it as it is strictly a todo application, and doesn&#x27;t support any form of knowledge management (by design, which makes sense!)<p>So I&#x27;m wondering, what processes do people follow for their todo list management and knowledge management? What resources have you learned how to use your applications of choice?<p>My requirements (in rough priority order):<p>- Mobile + Desktop support (PWA, web UI, native application, all fine!)<p>- Searchable<p>- Allows me to keep track of todos with priority ordering and sublists<p>- Allows me to easily capture one-off ideas, as well as expand them into richer, more detailed concepts<p>- FOSS + Self-Hostable<p>The issues I&#x27;ve faced with previous solutions are:<p>- No integration between my todos and knowledge!<p>- Not being able to search<p>- Not being able to quickly capture ideas&#x2F;notes&#x2F;todos<p>- Not having a clean(-ish) UX to navigate between points of info&#x2F;see what my next priorities are",

Projects like [Doom running inside a PDF](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678754) and [3D Terrain simulations for hiking and skiing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660255) are not just about tech wizardry; they’re a testament to the enduring appeal of classic games. It’s like finding a vintage car fitted with a Tesla engine—familiar, yet thrillingly modern.\n\n2. **The Open Source Renaissance**:\n   Tools like [SimpleGantt](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42647668) and [Stagehand](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42635942) remind us of the power of open source. These tools don’t just lower the barrier to entry; they practically obliterate it. They’re like public libraries for code—accessible, resourceful, and community-driven, proving that great tools don’t need a hefty price tag.\n\n3. **Learning Through Visualization**:\n   Platforms such as [Atlas of Space](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42634787) and [Flexbox Playground](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42600586) are turning complex ideas into something tangible. It’s like turning calculus into a painting. By making the abstract concrete, these tools are redefining how we learn, one interactive visualization at a time.\n\n## Shadows in the Tech Landscape\n\n1. **Security, The Eternal Nemesis**:\n   Whenever we push the envelope, security tends to push back. Projects like [Tetris in a PDF](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42645218) spark debates about vulnerabilities lurking in these innovative formats. It’s the classic tension between freedom and control—how much risk are we willing to accept for the sake of progress?\n\n2. **The Fragmentation Frustration**:\n   Discussions like [What is a common PR review time at your company?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656621) reveal the gnarly underbelly of software development: disjointed tools and processes. It’s like trying to run a marathon in mismatched shoes. The inefficiencies eat away at productivity, begging for a more unified approach.\n\n3. **AI: The Oversold Dream?**:\n   There’s a distinct wariness around AI, especially with the hype surrounding it in events like [Nvidia's CES keynote](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42670808). AI promises the moon, but users often find themselves holding a handful of dust. The gap between marketing glitz and actual utility is a chasm that’s yet to be bridged.\n\n## The Unexpected Twists\n\n1. **Retro Tech Resurgence**:\n   Who would’ve thought typewriters would make a comeback? Posts like [I'm a Programmer Who Bought a Typewriter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660042) highlight a craving for simplicity. In an age of distractions, sometimes less is more—a reminder that progress isn’t always about more features.\n\n2. **Community as the New Innovator**:\n   The revival of [Mashups.io](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42609819) mirrors the resilience of community-driven innovation. It’s like a phoenix rising from the ashes of Yahoo Pipes. When companies abandon platforms, the community steps in, driven by a genuine need for user-centric solutions.\n\n3. **The Fusion of Disciplines**:\n   Projects like [HipScript](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42623593) show us the magic that happens when disciplines intersect. Running CUDA in browsers? That’s like discovering a Swiss Army knife where you least expect it. This cross-pollination opens doors to new possibilities we hadn’t dared imagine.\n\n## The Balancing Act\n\nThe tech world is a dance of optimism and skepticism. With every innovation comes the question of its real-world impact—will it live up to the hype? Yet, amidst the challenges, there’s a clear sense of excitement. The community continues to navigate this delicate balance, ever hopeful, yet grounded in the realities of implementation, security, and usability.",
